<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>CLASSICAL.</h3>


<p>In undertaking to write these few chapters on the
lives of the book-collectors, we feel that we must move
between lines that seem somewhat narrow, having
regard to the possible range of the subject. We
shall therefore avoid as much as possible the description
of particular books, and shall endeavour to deal
with the book-collector or book-hunter, as distinguished
from the owner of good books, from librarians
and specialists, from the merchant or broker of books
and the book-glutton who wants all that he sees.</p>

<p>Guillaume Postel and his friends found time to
discuss the merits of the authors before the Flood.
Our own age neglects the libraries of Shem, and casts
doubts on the antiquity of the Book of Enoch. But
even in writing the briefest account of the great book-collectors,
we are compelled to go back to somewhat
remote times, and to say at least a few words about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
ancient book-stories from the far East, from Greece
and Rome, from Egypt and Pontus and Asia. We
have seen the brick-libraries of Nineveh and the
copies for the King at Babylon, and we have heard
of the rolls of Ecbatana. All the world knows how
Nehemiah 'founded a library,' and how the brave
Maccab&aelig;us gathered again what had been lost by
reason of the wars. Every desert in the East seems
to have held a library, where the pillars of some
temple lie in the sand, and where dead men 'hang
their mute thoughts on the mute walls around.' The
Egyptian traveller sees the site of the book-room of
Rameses that was called the 'Hospital for the Soul.'
There was a library at the breast of the Sphinx, and
another where Cairo stands, and one at Alexandria
that was burned in Julius C&aelig;sar's siege, besides the
later assemblage in the House of Serapis which Omar
was said to have sacrificed as a tribute of respect for
the Koran.</p>

<p>Asia Minor was celebrated for her libraries. There
were 'many curious books' in Ephesus, and rich stores
of books at Antioch on the Orontes, and where the
gray-capped students 'chattered like water-fowl' by
the river at Tarsus. In Pergamus they made the
fine parchment like ivory, beloved, as an enemy has
said, by 'yellow bibliomaniacs whose skins take the
colour of their food'; and there the wealthy race of
Attalus built up the royal collection which Antony
captured in war and sent as a gift to Cleopatra.</p>

<p>It pleased the Greeks to invent traditions about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the books of Polycrates at Samos, or those of Pisistratus
that were counted among the spoils of Xerxes:
and the Athenians thought that the very same
volumes found their way home again after the
victories of Alexander the Great. Aristotle owned
the first private library of which anything is actually
recorded; and it is still a matter of interest to follow
the fortunes of his books. He left them as a legacy
to a pupil, who bequeathed them to his librarian
Neleus: and his family long preserved the collection
in their home near the ruins of Troy. One portion
was bought by the Ptolemies for their great Alexandrian
library, and these books, we suppose, must
have perished in the war with Rome. The rest
remained at home till there was some fear of their
being confiscated and carried to Pergamus. They
were removed in haste and stowed away in a cave,
where they nearly perished in the damp. When the
parchments were disinterred they became the property
of Apellicon, to whom the saying was first
applied that he was 'rather a bibliophile than a lover
of learning.' While the collection was at Athens he
did much damage to the scrolls by his attempt to
restore their worm-eaten paragraphs. Sulla took
the city soon afterwards, and carried the books to
Rome, and here more damage was done by the careless
editing of Tyrannion, who made a trade of copying
'Aristotle's books' for the libraries that were
rising on all sides at Rome.</p>

<p>The Romans learned to be book-collectors in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
gathering the spoils of war. When Carthage fell,
the books, as some say, were given to native chieftains,
the predecessors of King Jugurtha in culture
and of King Juba in natural science: others say that
they were awarded as a kind of compensation to the
family of the murdered Regulus. Their preservation is
attested by the fact that the Carthaginian texts were
cited centuries afterwards by the writers who described
the most ancient voyages in the Atlantic. When the
unhappy Perseus was deprived of the kingdom of
Macedonia, the royal library was chosen by &AElig;milius
Paullus as the general's share of the plunder. Asinius
Pollio furnished a great reading-room with the literary
treasures of Dalmatia. A public library was established
by Julius C&aelig;sar on the Aventine, and two
were set up by Augustus within the precinct of the
palace of the C&aelig;sars; and Octavia built another
near the Tiber in memory of the young Marcellus.
The gloomy Domitian restored the library at the
Capitol, which had been struck and fired by lightning.
Trajan ransacked the wealth of the world for his
collection in the 'Ulpiana,' which, in accordance with
a later fashion, became one of the principal attractions
of the Therm&aelig; of Diocletian.</p>

<p>The splendours of the private library began in the
days of Lucullus. Enriched with the treasure of
King Mithridates and all the books of Pontus, he
housed his collection in such stately galleries, thronged
with a multitude of philosophers and poets, that it
seemed as if there were a new home for the Muses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and a fresh sanctuary for Hellas. Seneca, a philosopher
and a millionaire himself, inveighed against
such useless pomp. He used to rejoice at the blow
that fell on the arrogant magnificence of Alexandria.
'Our idle book-hunters,' he said, 'know about nothing
but titles and bindings: their chests of cedar and ivory,
and the book-cases that fill the bath-room, are nothing
but fashionable furniture, and have nothing to do with
learning.' Lucian was quite as severe on the book-hunters
of the age of the Antonines. The bibliophile
goes book in hand, like the statue of Bellerophon
with the letter, but he only cares for the choice vellum
and bosses of gold. 'I cannot conceive,' said Lucian,
'what you expect to get out of your books; yet you
are always poring over them, and binding and tying
them, and rubbing them with saffron and oil of cedar,
as if they could make you eloquent, when by nature
you are as dumb as a fish.' He compares the industrious
dunce to an ass at a music-book, or to a monkey
that remains a monkey still for all the gold on its
jacket. 'If books,' he adds, 'have made you what
you are, I am sure that you ought of all things to
avoid them.'</p>

<p>After the building of Constantinople a home for
literature was found in the eastern cities; and, as the
boundaries of the empire were broken down by the
Saracen advance, learning gradually retired to the
colleges and basilicas of the capital, and to the Greek
monasteries of stony Athos, and Patmos, and the
'green Erebinthus.' Among the Romans of the East<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
we cannot discern many learned men, but we know
that there was a multitude ready to assist in the preservation
of learning. The figures of three or four
true book-lovers stand out amid the crowd of <i>dilettanti</i>.
St. Pamphilus was a student at the legal
University of Beyrout before he was received into the
Church: he devoted himself afterwards to the school
of sacred learning which he established at C&aelig;sarea
in Palestine. Here he gathered together about 30,000
volumes, almost all consisting of the works of the
Fathers. His personal labour was given to the works
of Origen, in whose mystical doctrine he had become
a proficient at Alexandria. The martyrdom of Pamphilus
prevented the completion of his own elaborate
commentaries. He left the library to the Church of
C&aelig;sarea, under the superintendence of his friend
Eusebius. St. Jerome paid a visit to the collection
while he was still enrolled on the list of bibliophiles.
He had bought the best books to be found at Tr&ecirc;ves
and Aquileia; he had seen the wealth of Rome, and
was on his way to the oriental splendour of Constantinople:
it is from him that we first hear of the gold
and silver inks and the Tyrian purple of the vellum.
He declared that he had never seen anything to compare
with the library of Pamphilus; and when he was
given twenty-five volumes of Origen in the martyr's
delicate writing, he vowed that he felt richer than if
he had found the wealth of Cr&oelig;sus.</p>

<p>The Emperor Julian was a pupil of Eusebius, and
became reader for a time in the Church at C&aelig;sarea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
He was passionately fond of books, and possessed
libraries at Antioch and Constantinople, as well as in
his beloved 'Lutetia' on the island in the Seine. A
sentence from one of his letters was carved over the
door of his library at Antioch: 'Some love horses, or
hawks and hounds, but I from my boyhood have
pined with a desire for books.'</p>

<p>It is said that another of his libraries was burned
by his successor Jovian in a parody of Alexander's
Feast. It is true, at any rate, that the book-butcher
set fire to the books at Antioch as part of his revenge
against the Apostate. One is tempted to dwell on
the story of these massacres. In many a war, as an
ancient bibliophile complained, have books been
dispersed abroad, 'dismembered, stabbed, and mutilated':
'they were buried in the earth or drowned in
the sea, and slain by all kinds of slaughter.' 'How
much of their blood the warlike Scipio shed: how
many on the banishment of Boethius were scattered
like sheep without a shepherd!' Perhaps the subject
should be isolated in a separate volume, where the
rude Omar, and Jovian, and the despoilers of the
monasteries, might be pilloried. Seneca would be
indicted for his insult to Cleopatra's books: Sir
Thomas Browne might be in danger for his saying,
that 'he could with patience behold the urn and
ashes of the Vatican, could he with a few others
recover the perished leaves of Solomon.' He might
escape by virtue of his saving clause, and some
excuse would naturally be found for Seneca; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
rest might be treated like those Genoese criminals
who were commemorated on marble tablets as 'the
worst of mankind.'</p>

<p>For several generations after the establishment of
the Eastern Empire, Constantinople was the literary
capital of the world and the main repository of the
arts and sciences. Mr. Middleton has lately shown
us in his work upon Illuminated Manuscripts that
Persia and Egypt, as well as the Western Countries,
'contributed elements both of design and technical
skill which combined to create the new school of
Byzantine art.' Constantinople, he tells us, became
for several centuries the main centre for the production
of manuscripts. Outside the domain of art we find
little among the Romans of the East that can in any
sense be called original. They were excellent at an
epitome or a lexicon, and were very successful as
librarians. The treasures of antiquity, as Gibbon has
said, were imparted in such extracts and abridgments
'as might amuse the curiosity without oppressing the
indolence of the public.' The Patriarch Photius
stands out as a literary hero among the commentators
and critics of the ninth century. That famous book-collector,
in analysing the contents of his library for
an absent brother, became the preserver of many of
the most valuable classics. As Commander of the
Guard he led the life of a peaceful student: as
Patriarch of Byzantium his turbulence rent the fabric
of Christendom, and he was 'alternately excommunicated
and absolved by the synods of the East<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and West.' We owe the publication of the work
called <i>The Myriad of Books</i> to the circumstance
that he was appointed to an embassy at Bagdad.
His brother wrote to remind him of their pleasant
evenings in the library when they explored the
writings of the ancients and made an analysis of their
contents. Photius was about to embark on a dangerous
journey, and he was implored to leave a record of
what had been done since his brother had last taken
part in the readings. The answer of Photius was the
book already mentioned: he reviews nearly three
hundred volumes of the historians and orators, the
philosophers and theologians, the travellers and the
writers of romance, and with an even facility 'abridges
their narrative or doctrine and appreciates their style
and character.'</p>

<p>The great Imperial library which stood by St.
Sophia had been destroyed in the reign of Leo the
Iconoclast in the preceding age, and in an earlier
conflagration more than half a million books are said
to have been lost from the basilica. The losses by
fire were continual, but were constantly repaired.
Leo the Philosopher, who was educated under the care
of Photius, and his son and successor Constantine,
were renowned as the restorers of learning, and the
great writers of antiquity were collected again by
their zeal in the square hall near the Public Treasury.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the realm of learning extended
far beyond the limits of the Empire, and the Arabian
science was equally famous among the Moors of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Spain and in the further parts of Asia. We are told
of a doctor refusing the invitation of the Sultan of
Bokhara, 'because the carriage of his books would
have required four hundred camels.' We know that
the Ommiad dynasty formed the gigantic library at
Cordova, and that there were at least seventy others
in the colleges that were scattered through the kingdom
of Granada. The prospect was very dark in
other parts of Western Europe throughout the whole
period of barbarian settlement. We shall not endeavour
to trace the slight influences that preserved
some knowledge of religious books at the Court of
the Merovingian kings, or among the Visigoths and
Ostrogoths and Burgundians. We prefer to pause
at a moment preceding the final onslaught. The
letters of Sidonius afford us a few glimpses of the
literary condition of Southern Gaul soon after the
invasion of Attila. The Bishop of Clermont gives us
a delightful picture of his house: a verandah leads
from the <i>atrium</i> to the garden by the lake: we pass
through a winter-parlour, a morning-room, and a
north-parlour protected from the heat. Every detail
seems to be complete; and yet we hear nothing of a
library. The explanation seems to be that the Bishop
was a close imitator of Pliny. The villa in Auvergne
is a copy of the winter-refuge at Laurentum, where
Pliny only kept 'a few cases contrived in the wall for
the books that cannot be read too often.' But when
the Bishop writes about his friends' houses we find
many allusions to their libraries. Consentius sits in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a large book-room when he is composing his verses
or 'culling the flowers of his music.' When he visited
the Prefect of Gaul, Sidonius declared that he was
whirled along in a stream of delights. There were
all kinds of out-door amusements and a library filled
with books. 'You would fancy yourself among a
Professor's book-cases, or in a book-shop, or amid the
benches of a lecture-room.' The Bishop considered
that this library of the Villa Prusiana was as good as
anything that could be found in Rome or Alexandria.
The books were arranged according to subjects. The
room had a 'ladies' side'; and here were arranged
the devotional works. The illuminated volumes, as
far as can now be judged, were rather gaudy than
brilliant, as was natural in an age of decadence; but
St. Germanus was a friend of the Bishop, and as we
suppose of the Prefect, and his copy of the Gospels was
in gold and silver letters on purple vellum, as may
still be seen. By the gentlemen's seats were ranged
the usual classical volumes, all the works of Varro,
which now exist only in fragments, and the poets
sacred and profane; behind certain cross-benches was
the literary food of a lighter kind, more suited to the
weaker vessels without regard to sex. Here every one
found what would suit his own liking and capacity,
and here on the day after their arrival the company
worked hard after breakfast 'for four hours by the
water clock.' Suddenly the door was thrown open,
and in his uniform the head cook appeared and
solemnly warned them all that their meal was served,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and that it was as necessary to nourish the body as to
stuff the mind with learning.</p>

<p>When the barbarians were established through
Gaul and Italy the libraries in the old country-houses
must have been completely destroyed. Some faint
light of learning remained while Boethius 'trimmed
the lamp with his skilful hand'; some knowledge of
the classics survived during the lives of Cassiodorus
and Isidore of Seville. Some of the original splendour
may have lingered at Rome, and perhaps in Ravenna.
When Boethius was awaiting his doom in the tower
at Pavia, his mind reverted to the lettered ease of his
life before he had offended the fierce Theodoric. His
philosophy found comfort in thinking that all the
valuable part of his books was firmly imprinted on
his soul; but he never ceased regretting the walls
inlaid with ivory and the shining painted windows
in his old library at Rome.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>IRELAND&mdash;NORTHUMBRIA.</h3>


<p>The knowledge of books might almost have disappeared
in the seventh century, when the cloud of
ignorance was darkest, but for a new and remarkable
development of learning in the Irish monasteries.</p>

<p>This development is of special interest to ourselves
from the fact that the church of Northumbria was
long dependent on the Irish settlement at Iona. The
Anglians taught by Paulinus very soon relapsed into
paganism, and the second conversion of the North
was due to the missionaries of the school of St.
Columba. The power of Rome was established at
the Council of Whitby; but in the days when Aidan
preached at Lindisfarne the Northumbrians were
still in obedience to an Irish rule, and were instructed
and edified by the acts and lives of St. Patrick, of St.
Brigit, and the mighty Columba.</p>

<p>We shall quote some of the incidents recorded
about the Irish books, a few legends of Patrick and
dim traditions from the days of Columba, before
noticing the rise of the English school.</p>

<p>The first mention of the Irish books seems to be
contained in a passage of &AElig;thicus. The cosmography
ascribed to that name has been traced to very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
early times. It was long believed to have been
written by St. Jerome; but in its present form, at
least, the work contains entries of a much later date.
The passage in which Ireland is mentioned may be
even as late as the age of Columbanus, when Irish
monks set up their churches at W&uuml;rzburg and on the
shores of the Lake of Constance, or illuminated their
manuscripts at Bobbio under the protection of
Theodolind and her successors in Lombardy. A
wandering philosopher is represented as visiting the
northern regions: he remained for a while in the Isle
of Saints and turned over the painted volumes; but
he despised the native churchmen and called them
'Doctors of Ignorance.' 'Here am I in Ireland, at
the world's end, with much toil and little ease; with
such unskilled labourers in the field the place is too
doleful, and is absolutely of no good to me.'</p>

<p>Palladius came with twelve men to preach to the
Gael, and we are told that he 'left his books' at Cellfine.
The legendary St. Patrick is made to pass into
Ulster, and he finds a King who burns himself and
his home 'that he may not believe in Patrick.' The
Saint proceeds to Tara with eight men and a little
page carrying the book-wallet; 'it was like eight
deer with one fawn following, and a white bird on its
shoulder.'</p>

<p>The King and his chief Druid proposed a trial by
ordeal. The King said, 'Put your books into the water.'
'I am ready for that,' said Patrick. But the Druid
said, 'A god of water this man adores, and I will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
take part in the ordeal.' The King said, 'Put your
books into the fire.' 'I am ready for that,' said
Patrick. 'A god of fire once in two years this man
adores, and I will not do that,' said the Druid.</p>

<p>In the church by the oak-tree at Kildare St. Brigit
had a marvellous book, or so her nuns supposed.
The Kildare Gospels may have been illuminated as
early as Columba's time. Gerard de Barri saw the
book in the year 1185, and said that it was so
brilliant in colouring, so delicate and finely drawn,
and with such enlacements of intertwining lines that
it seemed to be a work beyond the powers of mortal
man, and to be worthy of an angel's skill; and,
indeed, there was a strong belief that miraculous help
had been given to the artist in his dreams.</p>

<p>The 'Book of Durrow' called <i>The Gospels of St.
Columba</i>, almost rivals the famous 'Book of Kells'
with which Mr. Madan will doubtless deal in his
forthcoming volume on Manuscripts. A native poet
declared that when the Saint died in 597 he had
illuminated 'three hundred bright noble books'; and
he added that 'however long under water any book
of the Saint's writing should be, not one single letter
would be drowned.' Our authorities tell us that the
Book of Durrow might possibly be one of the
three hundred, 'as it bears some signs of being earlier
in date than the Book of Kells.'</p>

<p>St. Columba, men said, was passionately devoted
to books. Yet he gave his Gospels to the Church at
Swords, and presented the congregation at Derry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with the volume that he had fetched from Tours,
'where it had lain on St. Martin's breast a hundred
years in the ground.' In one of the biographies there
is a story about 'Langarad of the White Legs,' who
dwelt in the region of Ossory. To him Columba came
as a guest, and found that the sage was hiding all
his books away. Then Columba left his curse upon
them; 'May that,' quoth he, 'about which thou art so
niggardly be never of any profit after thee'; and this
was fulfilled, 'for the books remain to this day, and
no man reads them.' When Langarad died 'all the
book-satchels in Ireland that night fell down'; some
say, 'all the satchels and wallets in the saint's house
fell then: and Columba and all who were in his
house marvelled at the noisy shaking of the books.'
So then speaks Columba: 'Langarad in Ossory,'
quoth he, 'is just now dead.' 'Long may it be ere that
happens,' said Baithen. 'May the burden of that
disbelief fall on him and not on thee,' said Columba.</p>

<p>Another tradition relates to St. Finnen's book that
caused a famous battle; and that was because of a
false judgment which King Diarmid gave against
Columba, when he copied St. Finnen's Psalter without
leave. St. Finnen claimed the copy as being the
produce of his original, and on the appeal to the
court at Tara his claim was confirmed. King
Diarmid decided that to every mother-book belongs
the child-book, as to the cow belongs her calf; 'and
so,' said the King, 'the book that you wrote, Columba,
belongs to Finnen by right.' 'That is an unjust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
judgment,' said Columba, 'and I will avenge it upon
you.'</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the Saint was insulted by the
seizure and execution of an offender who had taken
sanctuary and was clasped in his arms. Columba
went over the wild mountains and raised the tribes
of Tyrconnell and Tyrone, and defeated King
Diarmid in battle. When the Saint went to Iona he
left the copy of Finnen's Psalter to the head of the
chief tribe in Tyrconnell. It was called the <i>Book
of the Battle</i>, and if they carried it three times round
the enemy, in the sun's course, they were sure to
return victorious. The book was the property of
the O'Donnells till the dispersion of their clan. The
gilt and jewelled case in which it rests was made in
the eleventh century: a frame round the inner shrine
was added by Daniel O'Donnell, who fought in the
Battle of the Boyne. A large fragment of the book
remained in a Belgian monastery in trust for the
true representative of the clan; and soon after
Waterloo it was given up to Sir Neal O'Donnell, to
whose family it still belongs. It is now shown at the
Museum of the Royal Irish Academy. 'The fragment
of the original <i>Book of the Battle</i>', says O'Curry,
'is of small quarto form, consisting of fifty-eight
leaves of fine vellum, written in a small, uniform, but
rather hurried hand, with some slight attempts at
illumination.'</p>

<p>We have now to describe the great increase of
books in Northumbria. In the year 635 Aidan set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
up his quarters with a few Irish monks on the Isle
of Lindisfarne, and his Abbey soon became one of
the main repositories of learning.</p>

<p>The book called <i>The Gospels of St. Cuthbert</i> was
written in 688, and was regarded for nearly two
centuries as the chief ornament of Lindisfarne. The
monastery was burned by the Danes, and the servants
of St. Cuthbert, who had concealed the 'Gospels' in
his grave, wandered forth, with the Saint's body in
an ark and the book in its chest, in search of a new
place of refuge. They attempted a voyage to Ireland,
but their ship was driven back by a storm. The book-chest
had been washed overboard, but in passing up
the Solway Firth they saw the book shining in its
golden cover upon the sand. For more than a
century afterwards the book shared the fortunes of a
wandering company of monks: in the year 995 it
was laid on St. Cuthbert's coffin in the new church at
Durham; early in the twelfth century it returned to
Lindisfarne. Here it remained until the dissolution
of the monasteries, when its golden covers were torn
off, and the book came bare and unadorned into the
hands of Sir Robert Cotton, and passed with the
rest of his treasures into the library of the British
Museum.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/04.jpg"><img src="./images/04_th.jpg" alt="INITIAL LETTER FROM THE GOSPELS OF ST. CUTHBERT." title="INITIAL LETTER FROM THE GOSPELS OF ST. CUTHBERT." /></a></p><p class="figcenter">INITIAL LETTER FROM THE GOSPELS OF ST. CUTHBERT.</p>

<p>Theodore of Tarsus had been consecrated Archbishop
of Canterbury in the year 669. He brought
with him a large quantity of books for use in his new
Greek school. These books were left by his will to
the cathedral library, where they remained for ages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
without disturbance. William Lambarde, the Kentish
antiquary, has left an account of their appearance.
He was speaking of Archbishop Parker,
'whose care for the conservation of ancient monuments
can never be sufficiently commended.' 'The
reverend Father,' he added, 'showed me the <i>Psalter
of David</i>, and sundry homilies in Greek, and Hebrew
also, and some other Greek authors, beautifully
written on thick paper with the name of this
Theodore prefixed,' to whose library the Archbishop
thought that they had belonged, 'being thereto led
by a show of great antiquity.'</p>

<p>The monks of Canterbury claimed to possess the
books on pink vellum, with rubricated capitals, which
Pope Gregory had sent to Augustine. One of these
afterwards belonged to Parker, who gave it to Corpus
Christi at Cambridge: the experts now believe that
it was written in the eighth century 'in spite of the
ancient appearance of the figure-painting.' Another
is the <i>Psalter of St. Augustine</i>, now preserved among
the Cottonian <span class="smcap">mss</span>. This is also considered to be a
writing of the eighth century.</p>

<p>In the Bodleian library there is a third example,
written in quarto with large uncial letters in double
columns, in much the same style as the book given
by Parker to Corpus Christi. The Bodleian specimen
is especially interesting as containing on the fly-leaf
a list in Anglo-Saxon of the contents of the library
of Solomon the Priest, with notes as to other small
collections.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>We have reached the period in which Northumbria
became for a time the centre of Western culture.
The supremacy of Rome, set up at the Council of
Whitby, was fostered and sustained by the introduction
of the Italian arts. Vast quantities of books
were imported. Stately Abbeys were rising along
the coast, and students were flocking to seek the
fruits of the new learning in well-filled libraries and
bustling schools. We may judge how bright the
prospect seemed by the tone of Alcuin's letters to
Charles the Great. He tells the Emperor of certain
'exquisite books' which he had studied under Egbert
at York. The schools of the North are compared to
'a garden enclosed' and to the beds of spices: he
asks that some of the young men may be sent over
to procure books, so that in Tours as well as at York
they may gather the flowers of the garden and share
in the 'outgoings of Paradise.' A few years afterwards
came the news of the harrying of Northumbria
by the Vikings. The libraries were burned, and
Northumbria was overwhelmed in darkness and
slavery; and Alcuin wrote again, 'He who can hear
of this calamity and not cry to God on behalf of his
country, must have a heart not of flesh but of
stone.'</p>

<p>Benedict Biscop was our first English book-collector.
The son of a rich Thane might have looked
to a political career; he preferred to devote himself
to learning, and would have spent his life in a Roman
monastery if the Pope had not ordered him to return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to England in company with Theodore of Tarsus.
His first expedition was made with his friend St.
Wilfrid. They crossed in a ship provided by the
King of Kent. Travelling together as far as Lyons,
Wilfrid remained there for a time, and Benedict
pushed on to Mont Cenis, and so to Rome, after
a long and perilous journey. On a second visit he
received the tonsure, and went back to work at
Lindisfarne; but about two years afterwards he
obtained a passage to Italy in a trading-vessel, and
it was on this occasion that he received the Pope's
commands. Four years elapsed before he was in
Rome again: throughout the year 671 he was amassing
books by purchase and by the gifts of his friends;
and returning by Vienne he found another large store
awaiting him which he had ordered on his outward
journey. Benedict was able to set up a good library
in his new Abbey at Wearmouth; but his zeal appears
to have been insatiable. We find him for the fifth
time at the mart of learning, and bringing home, as
Bede has told us, 'a multitude of books of all kinds.'
He divided his new wealth between the Church at
Wearmouth and the Abbey at Jarrow, across the
river. Ceolfrid of Jarrow himself made a journey to
Rome with the object of augmenting Benedict's
'most noble and copious store'; but he gave to the
King of Northumbria, in exchange for a large landed
estate, the magnificent 'Cosmography' which his predecessor
had brought to Wearmouth.</p>

<p>St. Wilfrid presented to his church at Ripon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<i>Book of the Gospels</i> on purple vellum, and a Bible
with covers of pure gold inlaid with precious stones.
John the Precentor, who introduced the Roman
liturgy into this country, bequeathed a number of
valuable books to Wearmouth. Bede had no great
library of his own; it was his task 'to disseminate
the treasures of Benedict.' But he must have possessed
a large number of manuscripts while he was
writing the Ecclesiastical History, since he has informed
us that Bishop Daniel of Winchester and
other learned churchmen in the South were accustomed
to supply him constantly with records and
chronicles.</p>

<p>St. Boniface may be counted among the collectors,
though he could carry but a modest supply of books
through the German forests and the marshes of Friesland.
As a missionary he found it useful to display
a finely-painted volume. Writing to the Abbess
Eadburga for a Missal, he asked that the parchment
might be gay with colours,&mdash;'even as a glittering lamp
and an illumination for the hearts of the Gentiles.'
'I entreat you,' he writes again, 'to send me <i>St.
Peters Epistle</i> in letters of gold.' He begged all his
friends to send him books as a refreshment in the
wilderness. Bishop Daniel is asked for the <i>Prophecies</i>
'written very large.' Bishop Lulla is to send a cosmography
and a volume of poems. He applies to
one Archbishop for the works of Bede, 'who is the
lamp of the Church,' and to the other for the Pope's
<i>Answers to Augustine</i>, which cannot be found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Roman bookshops. Boniface was Primate of Germany;
but he resigned his high office to work among
the rude tribes of Friesland. We learn that he carried
some of his choicest books with him on his last ill-fated
expedition, when the meadow and the river-banks
were strewn with the glittering service-books
after the murder of the Saint and his companions.</p>

<p>Egbert of York set up a large library in the Minster.
Alcuin took charge of it after his friend's
death, and composed a versified catalogue, of such
merit as the nature of the task allowed. 'Here you
may trace the footsteps of the Fathers; here you meet
the clear-souled Aristotle and Tully of the mighty
tongue; here Basil and Fulgentius shine, and Cassiodorus
and John of the Golden Mouth.' As Alcuin
was returning from book-buying at Rome he met
Charles the Great at Parma. The Emperor persuaded
the traveller to enter his service, and they
succeeded by their joint efforts in producing a wonderful
revival of literature. The Emperor had a fine
private collection of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> adorned in the Anglo-Frankish
style; and he established a public library,
containing the works of the Fathers, 'so that the
poorest student might find a place at the banquet of
learning.' Alcuin presented to the Emperor's own
collection a revised copy of the Vulgate illuminated
under his personal supervision.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Alcuin's career he retired to
the Abbey of St. Martin at Tours, and there founded
his 'Museum,' which was in fact a large establishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
for the editing and transcription of books. Here he
wrote those delightful letters from which we have
already made an extract. To his friend Arno at
Salzburg he writes about a little treatise on orthography,
which he would have liked to have recited in
person. 'Oh that I could turn the sentences into
speech, and embrace my brother with a warmth that
cannot be sent in a book; but since I cannot come
myself I send my rough letters, that they may speak
for me instead of the words of my mouth.' To the
Emperor he sent a description of his life at Tours:
'In the house of St. Martin I deal out the honey of
the Scriptures, and some I excite with the ancient
wine of wisdom, and others I fill full with the fruits
of grammatical learning.'</p>

<p>Very few book-lovers could be found in England
while the country was being ravaged by the Danes.
The Northern Abbeys were burned, and their
libraries destroyed. The books at York perished,
though the Minster was saved; the same fate befell
the valuable collections at Croyland and Peterborough.
The royal library at Stockholm contains the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'interesing'">interesting</ins>
'Golden Gospels,' decorated in the same style as
the <i>Book of Lindisfarne</i>, and perhaps written at the
same place. An inscription of the ninth century
shows that it was bought from a crew of pirates by
Duke Alfred, a nobleman of Wessex, and was presented
by him and his wife Werburga to the Church
at Canterbury.</p>

<p>It seems possible that literature was kept alive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
our country by King Alfred's affection for the old
English songs. We know that he used to recite them
himself and would make his children get them by
heart. He was not much of a scholar himself, but he
had all the learning of Mercia to help him. Archbishop
Plegmund and his chaplains were the King's
secretaries, 'and night and day, whenever he had
time, he commanded these men to read to him.'
From France came Provost Grimbald, a scholar and
a sweet singer, and Brother John of Corbei, a paragon
in all kinds of science. Asser came to the Court
from his home in Wales: 'I remained there,' he says,
'for about eight months, and all that time I used to
read to him whatever books were at hand; for it was
his regular habit by day and night, amidst all his other
occupations, either to read to himself or to listen
while others read to him.' St. Dunstan was an ardent
admirer of the old battle-chaunts and funeral-lays.
He was, it need hardly be said, the friend of all kinds
of learning. The Saint was an expert scribe and a
painter of miniatures; and specimens of his exquisite
handiwork may still be seen at Canterbury and in the
Bodleian at Oxford. He was the real founder of the
Glastonbury library, where before his time only a few
books had been presented by missionaries from Ireland.
His great work was the establishment of the
Benedictines in the place of the regular clergy: and
the reform at any rate insured the rise of a number
of new monasteries, each with its busy 'scriptorium,'
out of which the library would grow. We must say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a word in remembrance of Archbishop &AElig;lfric, the
author of a great part of our English Chronicle. He
was trained at Winchester, where the illuminators, it
is said, were 'for a while the foremost in the world.'
He enacted that every priest should have at least a
psalter and hymn-book and half a dozen of the most
important service-books, before he could hope for
ordination. His own library, containing many works
of great value, was bequeathed to the Abbey of St.
Alban's. We end the story of the Anglo-Saxon
books with a mention of Leofric, the first Bishop of
Exeter, who gave a magnificent donation out of his
own library to the Cathedral Church. The catalogue
is still extant, and some of the volumes are preserved
at Oxford. There were many devotional works of
the ordinary kind; there were 'reading-books for
winter and summer,' and song-books, and especially
'night-songs'; but the greatest treasure of all was the
'great book of English poetry,' known as the Exeter
Book, in which Cynewulf sang of the ruin of the
'purple arch,' and set forth the Exile's Lament and
the Traveller's Song.</p>

<h3>ENGLAND.</h3>


<p>A more austere kind of learning came in with the
Norman Conquest. Lanfranc and Anselm introduced
at Canterbury a devotion to science, to the doctrines
of theology and jurisprudence, and to the new discoveries
which Norman travellers were bringing back
from the schools at Salerno. Lanfranc imported a
large quantity of books from the Continent. He
would labour day and night at correcting the work of
his scribes; and Anselm, when he succeeded to the
See, used often to deprive himself of rest to finish the
transcription of a manuscript. Lanfranc, we are told,
was especially generous in lending his books: among
a set which he sent to St. Alban's we find the names of
twenty-eight famous treatises, besides a large number
of missals and other service-books, and two 'Books of
the Gospels,' bound in silver and gold, and ornamented
with valuable jewels.</p>

<p>A historian of our own time has said that England
in the twelfth century was the paradise of scholars. Dr.
Stubbs imagined a foreign student making a tour
through the country and endeavouring to ascertain its
proper place in the literary world. He would have
seen a huge multitude of books, and 'such a supply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of readers and writers' as could not have been found
elsewhere, except perhaps in the University of Paris.
Canterbury was a great literary centre. At Winchester
there was a whole school of historians; at
Lincoln he might listen to Walter Map or learn at
the feet of St. Hugh. 'Nothing is more curious than
the literary activity going on in the monasteries;
manuscripts are copied; luxurious editions are recopied
and illuminated; there is no lack of generosity
in lending or of boldness in borrowing; there is brisk
competition and open rivalry.'</p>

<p>The Benedictines were ever the pioneers of learning:
the regular clergy were still the friends of their books,
and 'delighted in their communion with them,' as the
Philobiblon phrased it. We gather from the same
source the lamentation of the books in the evil times
that followed. The books complain that they are
cast from their shelves into dark corners, ragged and
shivering, and bereft of the cushions which propped
up their sides. 'Our vesture is torn off by violent
hands, so that our souls cleave to the ground, and our
glory is laid in the dust.' The old-fashioned clergy
had been accustomed to treat religious books with
reverence, and would copy them out most carefully in
the intervals of the canonical hours. The monks used
to give even their time of rest to the decoration of
the volumes which added a splendour to their monasteries.
But now, it is complained, the Regulars even
reject their own rule that books are to be asked for
every day. They carry bows and arrows, or sword<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and buckler, and play at dice and draughts, and give
no alms except to their dogs. 'Our places are taken
by hawks and hounds, or by that strange creature,
woman, from whom we taught our pupils to flee as
from an asp or basilisk. This creature, ever jealous
and implacable, spies us out in a corner hiding behind
some ancient cabinet, and she wrinkles her forehead
and laughs us to scorn, and points to us as the only
rubbish in the house; and she complains that we are
totally useless, and recommends our being bartered
away at once for fine caps and cambrics or silks, for
double-dyed purple stuffs, for woollen and linen and
fur.' 'Nay,' they add, 'we are sold like slaves or
left as unredeemed pledges in taverns: we are given
to cruel butchers to be slaughtered like sheep or
cattle. Every tailor, or base mechanic may keep us
shut up in his prison.' Worst of all was the abominable
ingratitude that sold the illuminated vellums to
ignorant painters, or to goldsmiths who only wanted
these 'sacred vessels' as receptacles for their sheets of
gold-leaf. 'Flocks and fleeces, crops and herds,
gardens and orchards, the wine and the wine-cup, are
the only books and studies of the monks.' They are
reprehended for their banquets and fine clothes and
monasteries towering on high like a castle in its bulwarks:
'For such things as these,' the supplication
continues, 'we, their books, are cast out of their hearts
and regarded as useless lumber, except some few
worthless tracts, from which they still pick out a
mixture of rant and nonsense, more to tickle the ears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of their audience than to assuage any hunger of the
soul.'</p>

<p>A great religious revival began with the coming of
the Mendicant Friars, who, according to the celebrated
Grost&ecirc;te, 'illumined our whole country with the light
of their preaching and learning.' The Franciscans
and Dominicans reached England in 1224, and were
established at Oxford within two years afterwards,
where the Grey Friars of St. Francis soon obtained
as great a predominance as the Dominicans or Black
Friars had gained in the University of Paris. St. Francis
himself had set his face against literature. Professor
Brewer pointed out in the <i>Monumenta Franciscana</i>
that his followers were expected to be poor in heart
and understanding: 'total absolute poverty secured
this, but it was incompatible with the possession of
books or the necessary materials for study.' Even
Roger Bacon, when he joined the Friars, was forbidden
to retain his books and instruments, and was not
allowed to touch ink or parchment without a special
licence from the Pope. We may quote one or two of
the anecdotes about the Saint. A brother was arguing
with him on the text 'Take nothing with you on the
way,' and asked if it meant 'absolutely nothing';
'Nothing,' said the Saint, 'except the frock allowed
by our rule, and, if indispensable, a pair of shoes.'
'What am I to do?' said the brother: 'I have books
of my own,' naming a value of many pounds of silver.
'I will not, I ought not, I cannot allow it,' was the
reply. A novice applied to St. Francis for leave to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
possess a psalter: but the Saint said, 'When you
have got a psalter, then you'll want a breviary, and
when you have got a breviary you will sit in a chair
as great as a lord, and will say to some brother,
Friar! go and fetch me my breviary!' And he
laid ashes on his head, and repeated, 'I am your
breviary! I am your breviary!' till the novice was
dumbfounded and amazed; and then again the Saint
said that he also had once been tempted to possess
books, and he almost yielded to the request, but
decided in the end that such yielding would be sinful.
He hoped that the day would come when men would
throw their books out of the window as rubbish.</p>

<p>A curious change took place when the Mendicants
got control of the schools. It was absolutely necessary
that they should be the devourers of books if they
were to become the monopolists of learning. In the
century following their arrival, Fitz-Ralph, the Archbishop
of Armagh, complained that his chaplains
could not buy any books at Oxford, because they
were all snapped up by the men of the cord and cowl:
'Every brother who keeps a school has a huge collection,
and in each Convent of Freres is a great and
noble library.' The Grey Friars certainly had two
houses full of books in School Street, and their
brothers in London had a good library, which was in
later times increased and richly endowed by Sir
Richard Whittington, the book-loving Lord Mayor
of London.</p>

<p>There were some complaints that the Friars cared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
too much for the contents and too little for the condition
of their volumes. The Carmelites, who arrived
in England after the two greater Orders, had the
reputation of being careful librarians, 'anxiously protecting
their books against dust and worms,' and
ranging the manuscripts in their large room at Oxford
at first in chests and afterwards in book-cases. The
Franciscans were too ready to give and sell, to lend
and spend, the volumes that they were so keen to
acquire. A Dominican was always drawn with a book
in his hand; but he would care nothing for it, if it
contained no secrets of science. Richard de Bury had
much to say about the Friars in that treatise on the
love of books, 'which he fondly named Philobiblon,'
being a commendation of Wisdom and of the books
wherein she dwells. The Friars, he said, had preserved
the ancient stores of learning, and were always
ready to procure the last sermon from Rome or the
newest pamphlet from Oxford. When he visited
their houses in the country-towns, and turned out
their chests and book-shelves, he found such wealth
as might have lain in kings' treasuries; 'in those
cupboards and baskets are not merely the crumbs
that fall from the table, but the shew-bread which is
angel's food, and corn from Egypt and the choicest
gilts of Sheba.' He gives the highest praise to the
Preachers or Friars of the Dominican Order, as being
most open and ungrudging, 'and overflowing with a
with a kind of divine liberality.' But both Preachers
and Minorites, or Grey Friars, had been his pupils,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
his friends and guests in his family, and they had
always applied themselves with unwearied zeal to the
task of editing, indexing, and cataloguing the volumes
in the library. 'These men,' he cries, 'are the successors
of Bezaleel and the embroiderers of the ephod
and breast-plate: these are the husbandmen that sow,
and the oxen that tread out the corn: they are the
blowers of the trumpets: they are the shining Pleiades
and the stars in their courses.'</p>

<p>Brother Agnellus of Pisa was the first Franciscan
missionary at Oxford, and the first Minister of the
Order in this county. He set up a school for poor
students, at which Bishop Grost&ecirc;te was the first reader
or master; but we are told that he afterwards felt
great regret when he found his Friars bestowing their
time upon frivolous learning. 'One day, when he
wished to see what proficiency they were making, he
entered the school while a disputation was going on,
and they were wrangling and debating about the
existence of the Deity. "Woe is me! Woe is me!"
he burst forth: "the simple brethren are entering
heaven, and the learned ones are debating if there be
one"; and he sent at once a sum of &pound;10 sterling to
the Court to buy a copy of the Decretals, that the
Friars might study them and give over their frivolities.'
The great difficulty was to prevent the brethren from
studying the doctrine of Aristotle, as it was to be
found in vile Latin translations, instead of attending
to Grost&ecirc;te, who was said to know 'a hundred thousand
times more than Aristotle' on all his subjects.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Grost&ecirc;te himself spent very large sums in importing
Greek books. In this he was helped by John
Basingstoke, who had himself studied at Athens, and
who taught the Greek language to several of the
monks at St. Alban's. Grost&ecirc;te upheld the eastern
doctrines against the teaching of the Papal Court,
and indeed was nicknamed 'the hammerer of the
Romans.' He based many of his statements upon
books which he valued as his choicest possessions;
but some of them, such as the <i>Testament of the
Patriarchs</i> and the <i>Decretals of Dionysius</i> are now
admitted to be forgeries. On Grost&ecirc;te's death in
1253 he bequeathed his library, rich in marginal
commentaries and annotations, to the Friars for
whom he had worked before he became Bishop and
Chancellor. Some generations afterwards their successors
sold many of the books to Dr. Gascoigne,
who used to work on them at the Minorites' Library:
and some of those which he bought found their way
to the libraries of Balliol, Oriel, and Lincoln; the
main body of Grost&ecirc;te's books was gradually dispersed
by gifts and sales, and dwindled down to little
or nothing; so that, when Leland paid his official
visit after the suppression of the monasteries, he
found very few books of any kind, but plenty of dust
and cobwebs, 'and moths and beetles swarming over
the empty shelves.'</p>

<p>It has been said that Richard de Bury had not
much depth of learning; and it has been a favourite
theory for many years that his book might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
been written for him by his secretary, the Dominican
Robert Holkot. The matter is not very important,
since it is certain, in spite of ancient and modern
detractors, that Richard de Bury or 'Aungerville'
was a most ardent bibliophile and a very devoted
attendant in the 'Library of Wisdom.' He was the
son of Sir Richard Aungerville, a knight of Suffolk;
but in accordance with a fashion of the day he was
usually called after his birthplace. He was born at
Bury St. Edmunds in the year 1287: he was educated
at Oxford, and afterwards took a prominent part in
the civil troubles, taking the side of Queen Isabel and
Edward of Windsor against the unfortunate Edward <span class="smcap">ii.</span>
He was appointed tutor to the Prince, and soon afterwards
became the receiver of his revenues in Wales.
When the Queen fled to her own country, Richard
followed with a large sum of money, collected by
virtue of his office; and he had a narrow escape for
his life, being chased by a troop of English lancers
as far as Paris itself, where he lay concealed for a
week in the belfry of the Minorites' Church. When
his pupil came to the throne many lucrative offices
were showered on his faithful friend. Richard became
Cofferer and Treasurer of the Wardrobe, and for five
years was Clerk of the Privy Seal; and during that
period he was twice sent as ambassador to the Pope
at Avignon, where he had the honour of becoming
the friend of Petrarch.</p>

<p>The poet has himself described his meeting with
the Englishman travelling in such splendid fashion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to lay before his Holiness his master's claims upon
France. 'It was at the time,' says Petrarch, 'when
the seeds of war were growing that produced such a
blood-stained harvest, in which the sickles are not
laid aside nor as yet are the garners closed.' He
found in his visitor 'a man of ardent mind and by
no means unacquainted with literature.' He discovered
indeed that Richard was on some points full
of curious learning, and it occurred to him that one
born and bred in Britain might know the situation
of the long-lost island of Thule. 'But whether he
was ashamed of his ignorance,' says Petrarch, 'or
whether, as I will not suspect, he grudged information
upon the subject, and whether he spoke his real mind
or not, he only answered that he would tell me, but
not till he had returned home to his books, of which
no man had a more abundant supply.' The poet
complains that the answer never came, in spite of
many letters of reminder; 'and so my friendship with
a Briton never taught me anything more about the
Isle of Thule.'</p>

<p>Richard was consecrated Bishop of Durham in
1333, after an amicable struggle between the Pope
and the King as to the hand that should bestow the
preferment. A few months afterwards he became
High Treasurer, and in the same year was appointed
Lord Chancellor. Within the next three years he
was sent on several embassies to France to urge the
English claims, and he afterwards went on the same
business to Flanders and Brabant. He writes with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a kind of rapture of his first expeditions to Paris; in
later years he complained that the study of antiquities
was superseding science, in which the doctors of the
Sorbonne had excelled. 'I was sent first to the
Papal Chair, and afterwards to the Court of France,
and thence to other countries, on tedious embassies
and in perilous times, bearing with me all the time
that love of books which many waters could not
extinguish.' 'Oh Lord of Lords in Zion!' he ejaculates,
'what a flood of pleasure rejoiced my heart
when I reached Paris, the earthly Paradise. How I
longed to remain there, and to my ardent soul how
few and short seemed the days! There are the
libraries in their chambers of spice, the lawns wherein
every growth of learning blooms. There the meads
of Academe shake to the footfall of the philosophers
as they pace along: there are the peaks of Parnassus,
and there is the Stoic Porch. Here you will find
Aristotle, the overseer of learning, to whom belongs
in his own right all the excellent knowledge that
remains in this transitory world. Here Ptolemy
weaves his cycles and epicycles, and here Gensachar
tracks the planets' courses with his figures and charts.
Here it was in very truth that with open treasure-chest
and purse untied I scattered my money with a
light heart, and ransomed the priceless volumes with
my dust and dross.'</p>

<p>He shows, as he himself confessed, an ecstatical
love for his books. 'These are the masters that teach
without rods and stripes, without angry words, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>out
demanding a fee in money or in kind: if you
draw near, they sleep not: if you ask, they answer
in full: if you are mistaken, they neither rail nor
laugh at your ignorance.' 'You only, my books!'
he cries, 'are free and unfettered: you only can give
to all who ask and enfranchise all that serve you.'
In his glowing periods they become transfigured into
the wells of living water, the fatness of the olive, the
sweetness of the vines of Engaddi; they seem to him
like golden urns in which the manna was stored, like
the fruitful tree of life and the four-fold river of Eden.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/05.jpg"><img src="./images/05_th.jpg" alt="SEAL OF RICHARD DE BURY." title="SEAL OF RICHARD DE BURY." /></a></p><p class="figcenter">SEAL OF RICHARD DE BURY.</p>

<p>Richard de Bury had more books than all the
other bishops in England. He set up several permanent
libraries in his manor-houses and at his palace
in Auckland; the floor of his hall was always so
strewed with manuscripts that it was hard to approach
his presence, and his bedroom so full of books that
one could not go in or out, or even stand still without
treading on them. He has told us many particulars
about his methods of collection. He had lived with
scholars from his youth upwards; but it was not
until he became the King's friend, and almost a
member of his family, that he was able 'to hunt in
the delightful coverts' of the clerical and monastic
libraries. As Chancellor he had great facilities for
'dragging the books from their hiding-places'; 'a
flying rumour had spread on all sides that we longed
for books, and especially for old ones, and that it
was easier to gain our favour by a manuscript than
by gifts of coin.' As he had the power of promoting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and deposing whom he pleased, the 'crazy quartos
and tottering folios' came creeping in as gifts instead
of the ordinary fees and New Year's presents. The
book-cases of the monasteries were opened, and their
caskets unclasped, and the volumes that had lain for
ages in the sepulchres were roused by the light of
day. 'I might have had,' he said, 'abundance of
wealth in those days; but it was books, and not bags
of gold, that I wanted; I preferred folios to florins,
and loved a little thin pamphlet more than an overfed
palfrey.' We know that he bought many books
on his embassies to France and Flanders, besides
his constant purchases at home. He tells us that
the Friars were his best agents; they would compass
sea and land to meet his desire. 'With such eager
huntsmen, what leveret could lie hid? With such
fishermen, what single little fish could escape the net,
the hook, and the trawl?' He found another source
of supply in the country schools, where the masters
were always ready to sell their books; and in these
little gardens and paddocks, as chances occurred,
he culled a few flowers or gathered a few neglected
herbs. His money secured the services of the
librarians and bookstall-men on the Continent, who
were afraid of no journey by land, and were deterred
by no fury of the sea. 'Moreover,' he added, 'we
always had about us a multitude of experts and
copyists, with binders, and correctors, and illuminators,
and all who were in any way qualified for the
service of books.' He ends his chapter on book-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>collecting
with a reference to an eastern tale, comparing
himself to the mountain of loadstone that
attracted the ships of knowledge by a secret force,
while the books in their cargoes, like the iron bars in
the story, were streaming towards the magnetic cliff
'in a multifarious flight.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ITALY&mdash;THE AGE OF PETRARCH.</h3>


<p>The enlightenment of an age of ignorance cannot
be attributed to any single person; yet it has been
said with some justice, that as the medi&aelig;val darkness
lifted, one figure was seen standing in advance, and
that Petrarch was rightly hailed as 'the harbinger of
day.' His fame rests not so much on his poems as
upon his incessant labours in the task of educating
his countrymen. Petrarch was devoted to books
from his boyhood. His youth was passed near
Avignon, 'on the banks of the windy Rhone.' After
receiving the ordinary instruction in grammar and
rhetoric, he passed four years at Montpellier, and
proceeded to study law at Bologna. 'I kept my
terms in Civil Law,' he said, 'and made some progress;
but I gave up the subject on becoming my
own master, not because I disliked the Law, which
no doubt is full of the Roman learning, but because
it is so often perverted by evil-minded men.' He
seems to have worked for a time under his friend
Cino of Pistoia, and to have attended the lectures of
the jurist Andrea, whose daughter Novella is said to
have sometimes taken the class 'with a little curtain
in front of her beautiful face.' While studying at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Bologna, Petrarch made his first collection of books
instead of devoting himself to the Law. His old
father once paid him a visit and began burning the
parchments on a funeral pile: the boy's supplications
and promises saved the poor remainder. He tried
hard to follow his father's practical advice, but
always in vain; 'Nature called him in another direction,
and it is idle to struggle against her.'</p>

<p>On Petrarch's return to Avignon he obtained the
friendship of Cardinal Colonna: and here the whole
course of his life was fixed when he first saw Laura
'in a green dress embroidered with violets.' Her face
was stamped upon his mind, and haunted him through
all efforts at repose: and perhaps it is to her influence
that he owed his rank among the lyrical poets and
the crown bestowed at Rome. His whole life was
thenceforth devoted to the service of the book. He
declared that he had the writing-disease, and was the
victim of a general epidemic. 'All the world is
taking up the writer's part, which ought to be confined
to a few: the number of the sick increases and
the disease becomes daily more virulent.' A victim
of the mania himself, he laughs at his own misfortune:
yet it might have been better, he thought, to
have been a labourer or a weaver at the loom.
'There are several kinds of melancholia: and some
madmen will write books, just as others toss pebbles
in their hands.' As for literary fame, it is but a
harvest of thin air, 'and it is only fit for sailors to
watch a breeze and to whistle for a wind.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Petrarch collected books in many parts of Europe.
In 1329, when he was twenty-five years of age, he
made a tour through Switzerland to the cities of
Flanders. The Flemish schools had lost something
of their ancient fame since the development of the
University of Paris. Several fine collections of books
were still preserved in the monasteries. The Abbey
of Laubes was especially rich in biblical commentaries
and other works of criticism, which were all
destroyed afterwards in a fire, except a Vulgate of
the eighth century that happened to be required for
use at the Council of Trent. Petrarch described his
visit to Li&egrave;ge in a letter to a friend; 'When we
arrived I heard that there was a good supply of
books, so I kept all my party there until I had one
oration of Cicero transcribed by a colleague, and
another in my own writing, which I afterwards
published in Italy; but in that fair city of the
barbarians it was very difficult to get any ink,
and what I did procure was as yellow as saffron.'</p>

<p>A few years afterwards he went from Avignon to
Paris, and was astonished at the net-work of filthy
lanes in the students' quarter. It was a paradise of
books, all kept at fair prices by the University's
decree; but the traveller declared that, except in
'the world's sink' at Avignon, he had never seen so
dirty a place. At Rome he was dismayed to find
that all the books were the prey of the foreigner.
The English and French merchants were carrying
away what had been spared by the Goths and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Vandals. 'Are you not ashamed,' he cried to his
Roman friends, 'are you not ashamed that your
avarice should allow these strangers every day to
acquire some remnant of your ancient majesty?'</p>

<p>He used to pore over his manuscripts on the most
incongruous occasions, like Pliny reading his critical
notes at the boar-hunt. 'Whether I am being shaved
or having my hair cut,' he wrote, 'and whether I am
riding or dining, I either read or get some one to read
to me.' Some of his favourite volumes are described
in terms of delightful affection. He tells us how
Homer and Plato sat side by side on the shelf,&mdash;the
prince of poets by the prince of philosophers. He
only knew the rudiments of Greek, and was forced to
read the Iliad in the Latin version. 'But I glory,'
he said, 'in the sight of my illustrious guests, and
have at least the pleasure of seeing the Greeks
in their national costume.' 'Homer,' he adds, 'is
dumb, or I am deaf; I am delighted with his looks;
and as often as I embrace the silent volume I cry,
"Oh illustrious bard, how gladly would I listen to
thy song, if only I had not lost my hearing, through
the death of one friend and the lamented absence of
another!"'</p>

<p>In his treatise on Fortune, Petrarch has left us
a study on book-collecting in the form of a dialogue
between his natural genius and his critical reason.
He argues, as it were, in his own person against the
imaginary opponent. A paraphrase will show the
nature and the result of the contest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>Petrarch.</i> I have indeed a great quantity of books.</p>

<p><i>Critic.</i> That gives me an excellent instance. Some
men amass books for self-instruction and others from
vanity. Some decorate their rooms with the furniture
that was intended to be an ornament of the soul, as
if it were like the bronzes and statues of which we
were speaking. Some are working for their own vile
ends behind their rows of books, and these are the
worst of all, because they esteem literature merely as
merchandise, and not at its real value; and this new
fashionable infliction becomes another engine for the
arts of avarice.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have a very considerable quantity of books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Well! it is a charming, embarrassing kind of
luggage, affording an agreeable diversion for the mind.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have a great abundance of books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Yes, and a great abundance of hard work
and a great lack of repose. You have to keep your
mind marching in all directions, and to overload your
memory. Books have led some to learning, and
others to madness, when they swallow more than
they can digest. In the mind, as in the body,
indigestion does more harm than hunger; food and
books alike must be used according to the constitution,
and what is little enough for one is too much
for another.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> But I have an immense quantity of books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Immense is that which has no measure, and
without measure there is nothing convenient or
decent in the affairs of men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have an incalculable number of books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Have you more than Ptolemy, King of Egypt,
accumulated in the library at Alexandria, which were
all burned at one time? Perhaps there was an excuse
for him in his royal wealth and his desire to benefit
posterity. But what are we to say of the private
citizens who have surpassed the luxury of kings?
Have we not read of Serenus Sammonicus, the
master of many languages, who bequeathed 62,000
volumes to the younger Gordian? Truly that was
a fine inheritance, enough to sustain many souls or
to oppress one to death, as all will agree. If Serenus
had done nothing else in his life, and had not read
a word in all those volumes, would he not have had
enough to do in learning their titles and sizes and
numbers and their authors' names? Here you have
a science that turns a philosopher into a librarian.
This is not feeding the soul with wisdom: it is the
crushing it under a weight of riches or torturing it
in the waters of Tantalus.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have innumerable books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Yes, and innumerable errors of ignorant
authors and of the copyists who corrupt all that
they touch.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have a good provision of books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> What does that matter, if your intellect cannot
take them in? Do you remember the Roman
Sabinus who plumed himself on the learning of his
slaves? Some people think that they must know
what is in their own books, and say, when a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
subject is started: 'I have a book about that in my
library!' They think that this is quite sufficient,
just as if the book were in their heads, and then they
raise their eyebrows, and there is an end of the
subject.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I am overflowing with books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Why don't you overflow with talent and
eloquence? Ah! but these things are not for sale,
like books, and if they were I don't suppose there
would be many buyers, for books do make a covering
for the walls, but those other wares are only clothing
for the soul, and are invisible and therefore neglected.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have books which help me in my studies.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Take care that they do not prove a hindrance.
Many a general has been beaten by having too many
troops. If books came in like recruits one would not
turn them away, but would stow them in proper
quarters, and use the best of them, taking care not
to bring up a force too soon which would be more
useful on another occasion.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have a great variety of books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> A variety of paths will often deceive the
traveller.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I have collected a number of fine books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> To gain glory by means of books you must
not only possess them but know them; their lodging
must be in your brain and not on the book-shelf.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> I keep a few beautiful books.</p>

<p><i>Crit.</i> Yes, you keep in irons a few prisoners, who,
if they could escape and talk, would have you indicted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for wrongful imprisonment. But now they lie groaning
in their cells, and of this they ever complain,
that an idle and a greedy man is overflowing with
the wealth that might have sustained a multitude
of starving scholars.'</p>

<p>Petrarch was in truth a careless custodian of his
prisoners. He was too ready to lend a book to a
friend, and his generosity on one occasion caused a
serious loss to literature. The only known copy of
a treatise by Cicero was awaiting transcription in
his library; but he allowed it to be carried off by an
old scholar in need of assistance: it was pledged in
some unknown quarter, and nothing was ever heard
again of the precious deposit.</p>

<p>He returned to Avignon in 1337, and made himself
a quiet home at Vaucluse. His letters are full of
allusions to his little farm, to the poplars in the
horse-shoe valley, and the river brimming out from
the 'monarch of springs.' In these new lawns of
Helicon he made a new home for his books, and
tried to forget in their company the tumults that
had driven him from Italy. In 1340 he received
offers of a laureate's crown from Rome, the capital
of the world, and from Paris, 'the birth-place of
learning.' 'I start to-day,' he wrote to Colonna, 'to
receive my reward over the graves of those who were
the pride of ancient Rome, and in the very theatre of
their exploits.' The Capitol resounded to such cheers
that its walls and 'antique dome' seemed to share in
the public joy: the senator placed a chaplet on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
brow, and old Stephen Colonna added a few words
of praise amid the applause of the Roman people.</p>

<p>At Parma, soon afterwards, Petrarch formed another
library which he called his 'second Parnassus.' At
Padua he busied himself in the education of an
adopted son, the young John of Ravenna, who lived
to be a celebrated professor, and was nicknamed 'the
Trojan Horse,' because he turned out so many excellent
Grecians. In a cottage near Milan the poet
received a visit from Boccaccio, who was at that time
inclined to renounce the world. He offered to give his
whole library to Petrarch: he did afterwards send to
his host a <i>Dante</i> of his own copying, which is now preserved
in the Vatican. The approach of a pestilence
led Petrarch to remove his home to Venice: and here
he was again visited by Boccaccio, this time in company
with Leontio Pilato, a Calabrian Greek trading
in books between Italy and Constantinople.</p>

<p>Leontio was the translator of Homer, and expounded
his poems from the Chair of Rhetoric at
Florence. He was a man of forbidding appearance,
and 'more obdurate,' said Petrarch, 'than the rocks
that he will encounter in his voyage': 'fearing that
I might catch his bad temper, I let him go, and gave
him a Terence to amuse him on the way, though I
do not know what this melancholy Greek could have
in common with that lively African.' Leontio was
killed by lightning on his return voyage; and there
was much anxiety until it could be ascertained that
his literary stock-in-trade had been rescued from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hands of the sailors. It was not till the end of the
century that Chrysoloras renewed the knowledge of
the classics: but we may regard the austere Leontio
as the chief precursor of the crowd of later immigrants,
each with a gem, or bronze, or 'a brown
Greek manuscript' for sale, and all eager to play
their parts in the restoration of learning.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his life Petrarch became tired
of carrying his books about. When he broke up the
libraries at Parma and Vaucluse he had formed the
habit of travelling with bales of manuscripts in a long
cavalcade; but he determined afterwards to offer the
collection to Venice, on condition that it should be
properly housed, and should never be sold or divided.
The offer was accepted by the Republic, and the
Palazzo Molina was assigned as a home for the poet
and his books. Petrarch, however, had other plans
for himself. He wished to be near Padua, where he
held a canonry; and he accordingly built himself a
cottage at Arqu&agrave;, among the Euganean Hills, about
ten miles from the city. A few olive-trees and a
little vine-yard sufficed for the wants of his modest
household; and there, as he wrote to his brother,
broken in body but easy in his mind, he passed his
time in reading, and prepared for his end. His only
regret was that there was no monastery near in which
he might see his beloved Gerard fulfilling his religious
duties. He seems to have given up his love for fine
books with other worldly vanities. He offers excuses
for the plain appearance of a volume of 'St. Augustine'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which he was sending as a present. 'One must not,'
said he, 'expect perfect manuscripts from scholars
who are engaged on better things. A general does
not sharpen the soldiers' swords. Apelles did not cut
out his own boards, or Polycletus his sheets of ivory;
some humble person always prepares the material
on which a higher mind is to be engaged. So is
it with books: some polish the parchment, and
others copy or correct the text; others again do the
illumination, to use the common phrase; but a loftier
spirit will disdain these menial occupations.' The
scholar's books are often of a rough and neglected
appearance, for abundance of anything makes the
owner 'careless and secure'; it is the invalid who is
particular about every breath of air, but the strong
man loves the rough breeze. 'As to this book of
the <i>Confessions</i>, its first aspect will teach you all about
it. Quite new, quite unadorned, untouched by the
corrector's fangs, it comes out of my young servant's
hands. You will notice some defects in spelling, but
no gross mistakes. In a word, you will perhaps find
things in it which will exercise but not disturb your
understanding. Read it then, and ponder upon it.
This book, which would enflame a heart of ice, must
set your ardent soul on fire.'</p>

<p>On a summer night of the year 1374, Petrarch died
peacefully at Arqu&agrave;, alone in his library. His few
remaining books were sold, and some of them may
still be seen in Rome and Paris. Those which he
had given to Venice suffered a strange reverse of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
fortune. How long the gift remained in the Palazzo
Molina we cannot tell. We conjecture that it was
discarded in the next century, before Bessarion presented
his Greek books to the senate, and became
the actual founder of the library of St. Mark. The
antiquary Tomasini found Petrarch's books cast aside
in a dark room behind the Horses of Lysippus.
Some had crumbled into powder, and others had
been glued into shapeless masses by the damp. The
survivors were placed in the Libraria Vecchia, and
are now in the Ducal Palace; but it was long before
they were permitted to enter the building that
sheltered the gift of Bessarion.</p>

<h3>OXFORD&mdash;DUKE HUMPHREY'S BOOKS&mdash;THE LIBRARY OF THE VALOIS.</h3>


<p>The University Library at Oxford was a development
of Richard de Bury's foundation. The monks of
Durham had founded a hall, now represented by Trinity
College, in which Richard had always taken a fatherly
interest. He provided the ordinary texts and commentaries
for the students, and was extremely anxious
that they should be instructed in Greek and in the
languages of the East. A knowledge of Arabic, he
thought, was as necessary for the study of astronomy
as a familiarity with Hebrew was requisite for the
understanding of the Scriptures. The Friars had
bought a good supply of Hebrew books when the
Jews were expelled from England; Richard not only
increased the available store, but supplied the means
of using it. 'We have provided,' he said, 'a grammar
in Greek and Hebrew for the scholars, with all the
proper aids to instruct them in reading and writing
those languages.' He formed the ambitious design
of providing assistance to the whole University out
of the books presented to the hall. The rules which
he drew up were not unlike those already in use at
the Sorbonne. Five students were chosen as wardens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of whom any three might be a quorum for lending
the manuscripts. Any book, of which they possessed
a duplicate, might be lent out on proper security:
but copying was not allowed, and no volume was on
any account to be carried beyond the suburbs. A
yearly account was to be taken of the books in store,
and of the current securities; and if any profit should
come to the wardens' hands it was to be applied to
the maintenance of the library.</p>

<p>When the Bishop died some of his books went back
to Durham; but the monks were generous towards the
hall, and on several occasions sent fresh supplies to
Oxford. It may also be observed that some of his
best <span class="smcap">mss.</span> were returned to the Abbey of St. Alban's.
He had bought about thirty volumes from a former
abbot for fifty pounds weight of silver; but the monks
had continually protested against a transaction which
they believed to be illegal, and on Richard's death
some of the books were given back, and others were
purchased by Abbot Wentmore from his executors.</p>

<p>De Bury's generous care for learning was imitated
in several quarters. A few years after his death the
Lady Elizabeth de Burgh made a bequest of a small
but very costly library to her College of Clare Hall
at Cambridge. Guy Earl of Warwick about the same
time gave a collection of illuminated romances to the
monks of Bordesley. John de Newton in the next
generation divided his collection of classics, histories,
and service-books, between St. Peter's College at Cambridge
and the Minster at York, where he had acted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
for some years as treasurer. The lending-library at
Durham Hall was the only provision for the public,
with the exception of a few volumes kept in the
'chest with four keys' at St. Mary's. Thomas
Cobham, Bishop of Worcester, had long been anxious
to show his filial love for the University: as early as
the year 1320 he had begun to prepare a room for a
library 'over the old congregation-house in the north
churchyard of St. Mary's'; and, though the work
was left incomplete, he gave all his books by will to
be placed at the disposal of the whole body of scholars.
Owing to disputes that arose between the University
and the College to which Cobham had belonged, the
gift did not take effect until 1367. The University
Library was established in the upper room, which
was used as a Convocation House in later times; it
is said not to have been completely furnished until
the year 1409, more than eighty years after the date
of the Bishop's benefaction. According to the first
statute for the regulation of Cobham's Library, the
best of the books were to be sold so as to raise a sum
of &pound;40, which according to the current rate of interest
would produce a yearly income of &pound;3 for the librarian;
the other books, together with those from the
University Chest, were to be chained to the desks for
the general use of the students. It was soon found
necessary to exclude the 'noisy rabble': and permission
to work in the library was restricted to
graduates of eight years' standing. Richard de Bury
had warned the world in his chapter upon the handling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of books, how hardly could a raw youth be made to
take care of a manuscript; the student, according to
the great bibliophile, would treat a book as roughly
as if it were a pair of shoes, would stick in straws to
keep his place, or stuff it with violets and rose-leaves,
and would very likely eat fruit or cheese over one
page and set a cup of ale on the other. An impudent
boy would scribble across the text, the copyist would
try his pen on a blank space, a scullion would turn
the pages with unwashed hands, or a thief might cut
out the fly-leaves and margins to use in writing his
letters; 'and all these various negligences,' he adds,
'are wonderfully injurious to books.'</p>

<p>A generous benefactor gave a copy of De Lyra's
'Commentaries,' which was set upon a desk in St.
Mary's Chancel for reference. A large gift of books
came from Richard Courteney, the Chancellor of the
University; and as a mark of gratitude he was allowed
free access to the library during the rest of his life.
Among the other benefactors whose good deeds are
still commemorated we find King Henry <span class="smcap">iv.</span>, who
helped to complete the library, his successor Henry <span class="smcap">v.</span>,
who contributed to its endowment as Prince of
Wales, and his brothers John Duke of Bedford and
Humphrey Duke of Gloucester; and the roll of a
later date includes the names of Edmund Earl of
March, Philip Repington Bishop of Lincoln, and the
munificent Archbishop Arundel.</p>

<p>The good Duke Humphrey has been called 'the
first founder of the University Library.' We know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
from the records of that time that his gifts were
acknowledged to be 'an almost unspeakable blessing.'
He sent in all about three hundred volumes during
his life, which were placed in the chests of Cobham's
Library as they arrived, to be transferred to the new
Divinity Schools as soon as room could be made for
the whole collection. He had intended to bequeath
as many more by way of an additional endowment,
but died intestate: and there was a considerable
delay before the University could procure the fulfilment
of his charitable design. When the books at
last arrived 'the general joy knew no bounds'; and
the title of 'Duke Humphrey's Library' was gratefully
given to the whole assemblage of books which
from several different quarters had come into the
University's possession.</p>

<p>The catalogue shows that the Duke's store had
consisted mainly of the writings of the Fathers and
Arabian works on science: there were a few classics,
including a Quintilian, and Aristotle and Plato in
Latin: the works of Capgrave and Higden were the
only English chronicles; but the Duke was a devotee
of the Italian learning, and his gifts to Oxford included
more than one copy of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
three separate copies of <i>Boccaccio</i>, and no less than
seven of <i>Petrarch</i>.</p>

<p>The fate of the libraries founded by De Bury and
Duke Humphrey of Gloucester was to perish at the
hands of the mob. Bishop Bale has told the sad
story of the destruction of the monastic libraries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
The books were used for tailors' measures, for scouring
candlesticks and cleaning boots; 'some they sold to
the grocers and soap-sellers'; some they sent across
the seas to the book-binders, 'whole ships-full, to the
wondering of foreign nations': he knew a merchant
who bought 'two noble libraries' for 40<i>s.</i>, and got thereby
a store of grey paper for his parcels which lasted
him for twenty years. The same thing happened at
Oxford. The quadrangle of one College was entirely
covered 'with a thick bed of torn books and manuscripts.'
The rioters in the Protector Somerset's time
broke into the 'Aungerville Library,' as De Bury's
collection was called, and burnt all the books. Some
of De Bury's books had been removed into Duke
Humphrey's Library, and met the same fate at the
Schools, with almost every other volume that the
University possessed. So complete was the destruction
that in 1555 an order was made to sell the desks
and book-shelves, as if it were finally admitted that
Oxford would never have a library again.</p>

<p>Some few of the Duke's books escaped the general
destruction. Of the half-dozen specimens in the
British Museum three are known by the ancient
catalogues to have been comprised in his gifts to the
University. Two more remain at Oxford in the
libraries of Oriel and Corpus Christi. We learn from
Mr. Macray that only three out of the whole number
of his <span class="smcap">mss.</span> are now to be found in the Bodleian. One
of them contains the Duke's signature: another is
of high interest as being a translation out of <i>Aristotle</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by Leonardo Aretino, with an original dedication to
the Duke. The third is a magnificent volume of
<i>Valerius Maximus</i> prepared, as we know from the
monastic annals, under the personal supervision of
Abbot Whethamstede, the 'passionate bibliomaniac'
of St. Alban's. It contains inscriptions, says Mr.
Macray, recording its gift for the use of the scholars,
with anathemas upon all who should injure it. 'If
any one steals this book,' says the Abbot, 'may he
come to the gallows or the rope of Judas.'</p>

<p class="figcenter">THE DUKE OF BEDFORD PRAYING BEFORE ST. GEORGE.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(<i>From the "Bedford Missal."</i>)</p>

<p>Many of the Duke of Gloucester's books had come
to him from the library of the French Kings at the
Louvre, which had been purchased and dispersed by
John, Duke of Bedford. The Duke himself was in
the habit of ordering magnificently illuminated books
of devotion, which he gave as presents to his friends.
The famous 'Bedford Missal' (really a Book of
Hours) was offered by the Duchess in his name
to Henry <span class="smcap">vi.</span>; and Mr. Quaritch possesses another
Book of Hours, which the Duke presented to
Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, as a wedding gift. The
House of Valois was always friendly to literature.
King John, who fought at Cre&ccedil;y, began a small
collection: he had the story of the Crusades, a tract
on the game of chess, and a book containing a French
version of <i>Livy</i>, which seems to have belonged afterwards
to Duke Humphrey, and to have found its
way later into the Abbey of St. Genevi&egrave;ve. His
son Charles le Sage was the owner of about 900
volumes, which he kept in his castle at the Louvre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The first librarian was Gilles Malet, who prepared a
catalogue in 1373, which is still in existence. Another
was compiled a few years afterwards by
Antoine des Essars, and a third was made for
Bedford when he purchased about 850 volumes out
of the collection in the year 1423. These lists were
so carefully executed that we can form a very clear
idea of the library itself and the books in their gay
bindings on the shelves. We are told that the
King was so devoted to his '<i>Belle Assembl&eacute;e</i>,' as
Christina of Pisa calls it, that not only authors and
booksellers, but the princes and nobles at the court,
all vied in making offerings of finely illuminated
manuscripts.</p>

<p>They were arranged in the three rooms of the
Library Tower. The wainscots were of Irish yew,
and the ceilings of cypress. The windows were filled
with painted glass, and the rooms were lit at night
with thirty chandeliers and a great silver lamp. On
entering the lowest room the visitor saw a row of
book-cases low enough to be used as desks or tables.
A few musical instruments lay about; one of the old
lists tells us of a lute, and guitars inlaid with ivory
and enamel, and 'an old rebec' much out of repair.
There were 269 volumes in the book-cases. We will
only mention a few of the most remarkable. There
was Queen Blanche's Bible in red morocco, and
another in white boards, Thomas Waley's rhymes
from Ovid with splendid miniatures, and Richard de
Furnival's <i>Bestiaire d'Amour</i>. One life of St. Louis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
stood in a '<i>chemise blanche</i>,' and another in cloth of
gold. St. Gregory and Sir John Mandeville were
clothed in indigo velvet. John of Salisbury had a
silk coat and long girdle, and most of the Arabians
were in tawny silk ornamented with white roses and
wreaths of foliage. Some bindings are noticed as
being in fine condition, and others as being shabby
or faded. The clasps are minutely described. They
would catch a visitor's eye as the books lay flat on
the shelves: and we suppose that the librarian intended
to show the best way of knowing the books
apart rather than to dwell on their external attractions.
The Oxford fashion was to catalogue according to
the last word on the first leaf, or the first word over
the page; but it was also a common custom to
distinguish important volumes by such names as <i>The
Red Book of the Exchequer</i>, or <i>The Black Book of
Carnarvon</i>.</p>

<p>We need not proceed to describe the other rooms.
On the first floor there were 260 books, consisting
for the most part of romances with miniature illuminations.
One of these was the <i>Destruction de
Th&egrave;bes</i>, which at one time belonged to the Duc de
la Valli&egrave;re, and is now in the National Library at
Paris. The upper floor contained nearly six hundred
volumes mostly concerned with astronomy and natural
science.</p>

<p>It appears from the memoranda in the lists that
there had been a habit of lending books to public
institutions and to members of the royal family from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the time when the library was first established; and
it is estimated that about two hundred of the books
must have been saved in this way to form the beginning
of a new library in the Louvre, which, after the
expulsion of the English, began to attain some importance
in the reign of Louis <span class="smcap">xi</span>.</p>

<h3>ITALY&mdash;THE RENAISSANCE.</h3>


<p>The study of the classics had languished for a time
after the deaths of Petrarch and Boccaccio. It revived
again upon the coming of Chrysoloras, who is said to
have lighted in Italy 'a new and perpetual flame.'
Poggio Bracciolini was one of his first pupils; and
he became so distinguished in literature that the
earlier part of the fifteenth century is known as the age
of Poggio. Leonardo Aretino describes the enthusiasm
with which the Italians made acquaintance with the
ancient learning. 'I gave myself up to Chrysoloras,'
he writes, 'and my passion for knowledge was so
strong that the daily tasks became the material of
my nightly dreams.' He told Cosmo de' M&eacute;dici,
when translating Plato's Dialogues, that they alone
seemed to be infused with real life, while all other
books passed by like fleeting and shadowy things.</p>

<p>We are chiefly concerned with Poggio as the discoverer
of long-lost treasures. He saved Quintilian
and many other classics from complete extinction.
'Some of them,' said his friend Barbaro, 'were already
dead to the world, and some after a long exile you
have restored to their rights as citizens.' As a
famous stock of pears had been named after an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Appius or Claudius, so it was said that these new
fruits of literature ought certainly to be named after
Poggio.</p>

<p>The sole remaining copy of an ancient work upon
aqueducts was discovered by him in the old library
at Monte Cassino, which had survived the assaults of
Lombards and Saracens, but in that later age seemed
likely to perish by neglect. We have the record of
an earlier visit by Boccaccio, in which the carelessness
of its guardians was revealed. The visitor, we are
told, asked very deferentially if he might see the
library. 'It is open, and you can go up,' said a
monk, pointing to the ladder that led to an open
loft. The traveller describes the filthy and doorless
chamber, the grass growing on the window-sills, and
the books and benches white with dust. He took
down book after book, and they all seemed to be
ancient and valuable; but from some of them whole
sheets had been taken out, and in others the margins
of the vellum had been cut off. All in tears at this
miserable sight, Boccaccio went down the ladder, and
asked a monk in the cloister how those precious
volumes had come to such a pass; and the monk
told him that the brothers who wanted a few pence
would take out a quire of leaves to make a little
psalter for sale, and used to cut off the margins to
make 'briefs,' which they sold to the women.</p>

<p>Poggio himself has described his discovery at the
Abbey of St. Gall. 'By good fortune,' he says, 'we
were at Constance without anything to do, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
occurred to us to go to the monastery about twenty
miles off to see the place where the Quintilian was
shut up.' The Abbey had been founded by the Irish
missionaries who destroyed the idols of Suabia, when
according to the ancient legend the mountain-demon
vainly called on the spirit of the lake to join in resisting
the foe. Its library had been celebrated in the
ninth century, when the Hungarian terror fell upon
Europe, and the barbarian armies in one and the same
day 'laid in ashes the monastery of St. Gall and the
city of Bremen on the shores of the Northern ocean';
but the books had been fortunately removed to the
Abbey of Reichenau on an island in the Rhine. 'We
went to the place,' said Poggio, 'to amuse ourselves
and to look at the books. Among them we found
the Quintilian safe and sound, but all coated with
dust. The books were by no means housed as they
deserved, but were all in a dark and noisome place
at the foot of a tower, into which one would not cast
a criminal condemned to death.' He describes the
finding of several other rare <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, and says: 'I have
copied them all out in great haste, and have sent
them to Florence.'</p>

<p>In 1418 he visited England in the train of Cardinal
Beaufort. He said that he was unable to procure
any transcripts, though he visited some of the
principal libraries, and must have seen that the collection
at the Grey Friars at least was 'well stocked
with books.' He was more successful on the Continent,
where he brought the <i>History</i> of Ammianus out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of a German prison into the free air of the republic
of letters. He gave the original to Cardinal Colonna,
and wrote to Aretino about transcripts: 'Niccolo has
copied it on paper for Cosmo de' M&eacute;dici: you must
write to Carlo Aretino for another copy, or he might
lend you the original, because if the scribe should be
an ignoramus you might get a fable instead of a
history.'</p>

<p>Among the pupils of Chrysoloras, Guarini of
Verona was esteemed the keenest philologist, and
John Aurispa as having the most extended knowledge
of the classics. Aurispa, says Hallam, came
rather late from Sicily, but his labours were not less
profitable than those of his predecessors; in the year
1423 he brought back from Greece considerably
more than two hundred <span class="smcap">mss.</span> of authors hardly
known in Italy; and the list includes books of Plato,
of Pindar, and of Strabo, of which all knowledge had
been lost in the West. Aurispa lectured for many
years at Bologna and Florence, and ended his days
at the literary Court of Ferrara. Philelpho was one
of the most famous of the scholars who returned
'laden with manuscripts' from Greece. To recover
a lost poem or oration was to go far on the road to
fortune, and a very moderate acquaintance with the
text was expected from the hero of the fortunate
adventure. When he lectured on his new discoveries
at Florence, where he had established himself in spite
of the M&eacute;dici, Philelpho according to his own account
was treated with such deference on all sides that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was overwhelmed with bashfulness; 'All the citizens
are turning towards me, and all the ladies and the
nobles exalt my name to the skies.' He was the
bitter enemy of Poggio, and of all who supported the
reigning family of Florence. Poggio had the art of
making enemies, though he was a courtier by profession
and had been secretary to eight Popes. He
raged against Philelpho in a flood of scurrilous
pamphlets; Valla, the great Latin scholar, was
violently attacked for a mere word of criticism, and
Niccolo Perotti, the grammarian, paid severely for
supporting his friend. Poggio was always in extremes.
His eulogies in praise of Lorenzo de' M&eacute;dici,
and Niccolo Niccoli of Florence are perfect in grace
and dignity; his invectives were as scurrilous as anything
recorded in the annals of literature.</p>

<p>Two generous benefactors preceded 'the father of
his country' in providing libraries for Florence.
Niccolo Niccoli by common consent was the great
M&aelig;cenas of his age; his passion for books was
boundless, and he had gathered the best collection
that had been seen in Italy for many generations.
The public was free to inspect his treasures, and any
citizen might either read or transcribe as he pleased;
'In one word,' wrote Poggio, 'I say that he was the
wisest and the most benevolent of mankind.' By his
will he appointed sixteen trustees, among whom was
Cosmo de' M&eacute;dici, to take charge of his books for
the State. Some legal difficulty arose after his death,
but Cosmo undertook to pay all liabilities if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
management of the library were left to his sole discretion;
and the gift of the 'Florentine Socrates'
was eventually added to the books which Cosmo had
purchased in Italy or had acquired in his Levantine
commerce.</p>

<p>Another citizen of Florence had rivalled the
generosity of Niccoli. The Chancellor Coluccio
Salutati was revered by his countrymen for the
majestic flow of his prose and verse. It is true that
Tiraboschi considered him to be 'as much like Virgil
or Cicero as a monkey resembles a man.' Salutati
showed his gratitude to Florence by endowing the
city with his splendid library. But in this case also
there were difficulties, and again the way was made
smooth by the prompt munificence of the M&eacute;dici.
Cosmo himself bought up Greek books in the Levant,
and was fortunate in securing some of the best
specimens of Byzantine art. His brother Lorenzo,
his son Pietro, and Lorenzo the Magnificent in the
next generation, all laboured in their turn to adorn
the Medicean collection. Politian the poet, and
Mirandula, the Ph&oelig;nix of his age, were the
messengers whom the great Lorenzo sent out to
gather the spoil; and he only prayed, he said, that
they might find such a store of good books that he
would be obliged to pawn his furniture to pay for
them.</p>

<p>On the flight of the reigning family the 'M&eacute;dici
books' were bought by the Dominicans at St. Mark's;
and they rested for some years in Savonarola's home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
stored in the gallery which holds the great choir-books
illuminated by Fr&agrave; Angelico and his companions.
In the year 1508 the monks were in
pecuniary distress, and were forced to sell the
books to Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span>, then Cardinal de' M&eacute;dici. He
took them to Rome to ensure their safety, but was
always careful to keep them apart from the official
assemblage in the Vatican; it is certain that he
would have restored them to Florence, if he had lived
a short <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'time time'">time</ins> longer. The patriotic design was
carried out by Clement <span class="smcap">vii.</span>, another member
of that book-loving family, and their hereditary
treasures at last found a permanent home in the
gallery designed by Michelangelo.</p>

<p>The 'M&eacute;dici books' were catalogued by a humble
bell-ringer, who lived to be a chief figure in the
literary world. Thomas of Sarzana performed the
task so well that his system became a model for
librarians. While travelling in attendance on a
Legate, the future Pope could never refrain from
expensive purchases; to own books, we are told, was
his ambition, 'his pride, his pleasure, passion, and
avarice'; and he was only saved from ruin by the
constant help of his friends. When he succeeded to
the tiara as Pope Nicholas <span class="smcap">v.</span>, his influence was
felt through Christendom as a new literary force.
He encouraged research at home, and gathered the
records of antiquity from the ruined cities of the East,
and 'the darkest monasteries of Germany and
Britain.' His labours resulted in the restoration of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the Vatican Library with an endowment of five thousand
volumes; and he found time to complete the
galleries for their reception, though he could never
hope to finish the rest of the palace. A great part of
his work was destroyed in 1527 by the rabble that
'followed the Bourbon' to the sack of Rome; but his
institution survived the temporary disaster, and its
losses were repaired by the energy of Sixtus <span class="smcap">v</span>.</p>

<p>Pope Nicholas had no sympathy with the
niggardly spirit that would have kept the 'barbarians'
in darkness. He opened his Greek treasure-house
to the inspection of the whole western world.
Looking back to the crowd round his chair at the
Lateran or in his house near S<sup>ta.</sup> Maria Maggiore,
we recognise a number of familiar figures. Perotti
is translating Polybius, and Aurispa explaining the
Golden Verses; Guarini enlarges the world's boundaries
by publishing the geography of Strabo. An
old tract upon the Pope's munificence shows how the
Eastern Fathers were restored to a place of honour.
Basil and Cyril were translated, and the Pope
obtained the <i>Commentary upon St. Matthew</i>, of which
Erasmus made excellent use in his Paraphrase: it
was the book of which Aquinas wrote that he would
rather have a copy than be master of the city of
Paris. The Pope desired very strongly to read
Homer in Latin verse, and had procured a translation
of the first book of the Iliad. Hearing that Philelpho
had arrived in Rome, he hoped that the work might
be finished by a master-hand, and to get a version of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the whole Iliad and Odyssey he gave a large retaining
fee, a palazzo, and a farm in the Campagna, and
made a deposit of ten thousand pieces of gold to be
paid on the completion of the contract.</p>

<p>Joseph Scaliger, the supreme judge in his day of
all that related to books, said that of all these men of
the Italian renaissance he only envied three. One of
course was Pico of Mirandula, a man of marvellous
powers, who rose as a mere youth to the highest
place as a philosopher and linguist. The next was
Politian, equally renowned for hard scholarship and
for the sweetness and charm of his voluminous poems.
The third was the Greek refugee, Theodore of Gaza,
so warmly praised by Erasmus for his versatile
talent; no man, it was said, was so skilled in the
double task of turning Greek books into Latin, and
rendering Latin into Greek.</p>

<p>We should feel inclined to bracket another name
with those of the famous trio. George of Trebisond
was a faithful expounder of the classics, the discoverer
of many a lost treasure, and the author of
a whole library of criticism. His life and labours
were denounced in the once celebrated <i>Book of
the Georges</i>. He was more than a lover of Aristotle,
said his enemies: he was the enemy of the
divine Plato, an apostate among the Greeks, who
had even dared to oppose their patron Bessarion.
The Cardinal Bessarion was complimented as 'the
most Latin of the Greeks'; he might have ruled
as Pope in Rome, some said, if it had not been for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Perotti refusing to disturb him in the library. But
George of Trebisond was vilified after Poggio's fashion,
and called 'brute' and 'heretic,' and 'more Turkish
than the filthiest Turk,' with a hailstorm of still
harder epithets. Yet he was certainly a very accurate
scholar; and he showed a proper manly spirit
when he boxed Poggio's ears in the Theatre of
Pompey for reminding him of the cleverness expected
from 'a starving Greek.' His life, one is glad
to think, had a very peaceful end. The old man had
a house at Rome in the Piazza Minerva: his tombstone,
much defaced, is before the curtain as one
enters the Church of S<sup>ta.</sup> Maria. His son Andrea
used to help him in his work, and launched a pamphlet
now and again at Theodore of Gaza. The
brilliant scholar fell into a second childhood, and
might be seen muttering to himself as he rambled
with cloak and long staff through the streets of
Rome. The grand-daughter who took charge of
him married Madalena, a fashionable poet; and
Pope Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span> delighted in hearing their anecdotes
about old times, when George and Theodore fought
their paper-wars, and wielded their pens in the battle
of the books.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the libraries in the
two great capitals, we ought to bestow a word or two
upon those splendidly endowed institutions by which
a few Florentine book-collectors have kept up the
literary fame of their city, without pretending to
emulate the splendour of the M&eacute;dici, or the wealth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the Vatican, or the curious antiquities of St. Mark.
We desire especially to say something in remembrance
of the 'Riccardiana' which, from its foundation
in the sixteenth century, has been famous for the value
of its historical manuscripts. Among these are the
journals of Fr&agrave; Oderigo, an early traveller in the
East, a treatise in Galileo's own writing, and a defence
of Savonarola's policy in the handwriting of
Pico of Mirandula. We may see a copy of Marshal
Strozzi's will, discussing his plans of suicide, a history
of the city composed and written out by Machiavelli,
and a large and interesting series of Poggio's literary
correspondence. The most celebrated of the librarians
was Giovanni Lami, who in the last century kept up
with such spirit a somewhat dangerous controversy
with the Jesuits; but his monument at Santa Croce
may have been owed less to his triumphs in argument
than to his passionate devotion to books. His
life was spent among them, and he died with a manuscript
in his arms; and his memory is still preserved
in Florence by the Greek collection with which he
endowed the University.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Marucelli left his name to another
Florentine library. He was a philanthropist as well
as a bibliophile; and he gave the huge assemblage
of books which he had gathered at Rome to the use
of the students in the home of his boyhood. He
wrote much, but was almost too modest to publish or
preserve his works. Perhaps the most interesting
portion of his gift consisted of a series of about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
hundred large folios in which, like the Patriarch
Photius, he had written in the form of notes the
results of the reading of a life-time.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/07.jpg"><img src="./images/07_th.jpg" alt="ANTONIO MAGLIABECCHI." title="ANTONIO MAGLIABECCHI." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">ANTONIO MAGLIABECCHI.</p>

<p>The Magliabecchian Library maintains the remembrance
of a portent in literature. Antonio Magliabecchi,
the jeweller's shop-boy, became renowned
throughout the world for his abnormal knowledge
of books. He never at any time left Florence; but
he read every catalogue that was issued, and was in
correspondence with all the collectors and librarians
of Europe. He was blessed with a prodigious
memory, and knew all the contents of a book by
'hunting it with his finger,' or once turning over the
pages. He was believed, moreover, to know the
habitat of all the rare books in the world; and according
to the well-known anecdote he replied to the
Grand Duke, who asked for a particular volume:
'The only copy of this work is at Constantinople, in
the Sultan's library, the seventh volume in the second
book-case, on the right as you go in.' He has been
despised as 'a man who lived on titles and indexes,
and whose very pillow was a folio.' Dibdin declared
that Magliabecchi's existence was confined to 'the
parade and pacing of a library'; but, as a matter of
fact, the old bibliomaniac lived in a kind of cave
made of piles and masses of books, with hardly any
room for his cooking or for the wooden cradle lined
with pamphlets which he slung between his shelves
for a bed. He died in 1714, in his eighty-second
year, dirty, ragged, and as happy as a king; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
certainly not less than eight thick volumes of sonnets
and epigrams appeared at once in his praise. He
left about 30,000 volumes of his own collecting, which
he gave to the city upon condition that they should
be always free to the public. The library that bears
his name contains more than ten times that number.
It includes about 60,000 printed books and 2000 <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
that once belonged to the Grand Dukes, and were kept
in their Palatine Galleries. There have been many
later additions; but the whole mass is now dedicated
to the worthiest of its former possessors, and remains
as a perpetual monument of the most learned and
most eccentric of bookmen.</p>

<h3>ITALIAN CITIES&mdash;OLYMPIA MORATA&mdash;URBINO&mdash;THE BOOKS OF CORVINUS.</h3>


<p>The memory of many great book-collectors has
been preserved in the libraries established from
ancient times in several of the Italian cities. There
are two at Padua, of which the University Library
may claim to have had the longer existence: but the
'Capitolina' can claim Petrarch as one of its founders,
and may boast of the books on antiquities gathered
by Pignoria, the learned commentator upon the remains
of Rome and the historian of his native city
of Padua. It may be worth noticing that there
were several smaller collections in the churches, due
to the industry of bookmen whose names have been
forgotten. We hear of the books of St. Anthony and
of Santa Giustina: and as to the library in the Church
of St. John the tradition long prevailed that Sixtus
of Sienna, a noted hunter after rare books, saw on its
shelves a copy of the <i>Epistle to the Laodiceans</i>, and
read it, and made copious extracts.</p>

<p>Mantua received many of the spoils of Rome from
Ludovico Gonzaga, which were lost in the later wars:
the most famous acquisition was Bembo's tablet of
hieroglyphics, which was interpreted by the patient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
skill of Lorenzo Pignoria. At Turin the King's Library
contains some of the papers and drawings of Ligorio,
who helped in the building of St. Peter's: but most of
his books were taken to Ferrara, where he held an
official appointment as antiquary. The University
Library contains the collections of the Dukes of
Savoy, including a quantity of Oriental <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, and
some of the precious volumes illuminated by the
monks of Bobbio. The P&egrave;re Jacob in his treatise
upon famous libraries had some personal anecdote
to record about the bookmen of each place that he
visited. At Naples he saw the collection of the works
of Pontanus, presented to the Dominicans by his
daughter Eugenia; at Bologna he found a long roll
of the Pentateuch, 'written by Esdras'; and at Ferrara
he described the tomb of C&oelig;lius, who was buried
among his books, at his own desire, like a miser in
the midst of his riches.</p>

<p>Ferrara derived a special fame from the munificence
of the House of Este and the memory of
Olympia Morata. A long line of illustrious princes
had built up 'an Athens in the midst of B&oelig;otia.'
Ariosto sang the praises of the literary Court, and
Tasso's misfortunes were due to his eagerness in
accepting its pleasures. The library of Lilio Giraldi
was a meeting-place for the scholars of Italy, and it
continued to be the pride of Ferrara when it passed
to Cinthio Giraldi the poet. Ren&eacute;e of France, after
the death of her husband, Duke Hercules, made
Ferrara a city of refuge for Calvin and Marot and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the fugitive Reformers from Germany. Olympia
Morata, the daughter of a Protestant citizen, was
chosen as the companion and instructress of the
Princess Anna. They passed a quiet life among
their books until a time of persecution arrived, when
Olympia found a hope of safety in marrying Andrew
Grundler of Schweinfurt. Her love for books appears
in the letters written towards the close of her life. In
1554 she tells Curio of the storming of Schweinfurt,
where she lost her library: 'when I entered Heidelberg
barefoot, with my hair down, and in a ragged
borrowed gown, I looked like the Queen of the
Beggars.' 'I hope,' she said, 'that with the other
books you will send me the Commentary on Jeremiah.'
Her friend answers that Homer and Sophocles are
on their way: 'and you shall have Jeremiah too,
that you may lament with him the misfortunes of
your husband's country.' Olympia replied from her
death-bed, returning her warmest thanks for the
books. 'Farewell, excellent Curio, and do not
distress yourself when your hear of my death. I
send you such of my poems as I have been able
to write out since the storming of Schweinfurt; all
my other writings have perished; I hope that you
will be my Aristarchus and will polish the poems;
and now again, Farewell.'</p>

<p>The Ducal Library of Ferrara was transferred to
Modena when the Duchy was added to the States of
the Church. The collection at Modena is still famous
for its illuminated <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, and for the care bestowed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Muratori and Tiraboschi in their selection of printed
books. The Court of Naples also might boast of
some illustrious bibliophiles. Queen Joanna possessed
one of those small <i>Livres d'Heures</i> of 'microscopic
refinement' which Mr. Middleton has classed among
the 'greatest marvels of human skill.' Ren&eacute; of
Anjou, her unfortunate successor, found a solace for
exile in his books, and showed in a Burgundian
prison that he could paint a vellum as cleverly as a
monkish scribe. Alfonso, the next King of Naples,
was a collector in the strictest sense of the term. He
would go off to Florence for bargains, and would
even undertake a commission for a book-loving
subject. Antonio Becatelli corresponded on these
matters with his royal master. 'I have the message
from Florence that you know of a fine Livy at the
price of 125 crowns: I pray your Majesty to buy it
for me and to send it here, and I will get the money
together in the meantime. But I should like your
Majesty's opinion on the point, whether Poggio or
myself has chosen the better part. He has sold
Livy, the king of books, written out by his own
hand, to buy an estate near Florence; but I, to get
my Livy, have put up all my property for sale by
auction.' The books collected by Alfonso were at
the end of the century carried off by Charles <span class="smcap">viii.</span>,
and were divided between the Royal Library at
Fontainebleau and the separate collection of Anne
of Brittany.</p>

<p>A romantic interest has always attached to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
library at Urbino. The best scholars in Europe
used to assemble at the palace, where Duke Federigo
made such a gathering of books 'as had not been
seen for a thousand years,' in the hall where Emilia
and the pale Duke Guidubaldo led the pleasant
debates described in the 'Cortegiano.' Federigo, the
most successful general in the Italian wars, had built
a palace of delight in his rude Urbino, in which he
hoped to set a copy of every book in the world. His
book-room was adorned with ideal portraits by Piero
della Francesca and Melozzo: it was very large and
lofty, 'with windows set high against the Northern
sky.' The catalogue of the books is still preserved
in the Vatican. It shows the names of all the
classics, the Fathers, and the medi&aelig;val schoolmen,
many works upon Art, and almost all the Greek and
Hebrew works that were known to exist. Among
the more modern writers we find those whose works
we have discussed, Petrarch and his friends, Guarini
and Perotti, and Valla with his enemy Poggio;
among the others we notice Alexander ab Alexandro,
a most learned antiquarian from Naples, of whom
Erasmus once said: 'He seems to have known everybody,
but nobody knows who he is.' The chief
treasure of the place was a Bible, illuminated in 1478
by a Florentine artist, which the Duke caused to
be bound 'in gold brocade most richly adorned
with silver.' 'Shortly before he went to the siege of
Ferrara,' says his librarian, 'I compared his catalogue
with those that he had procured from other places,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
such as the lists from the Vatican, Florence, Venice,
and Pavia, down to the University of Oxford in
England, and I found that all except his own were
deficient or contained duplicate volumes.' His son,
Duke Guidubaldo, was a celebrated Greek scholar;
and the eulogies of Bembo and Castiglione on his
Duchess, Elizabeth Gonzaga, attest the literary distinction
of her Court. Francesco, the third Duke,
lost his dominions to Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span>; but he showed his
good taste in stipulating that the books were to be
reserved as his personal effects. Some of the early-printed
books are still in the palace at Urbino;
others are at Castel Durante, or in the College of the
Sapienza at Rome; and the splendid <span class="smcap">mss.</span> form one
of the principal attractions of the Vatican.</p>

<p>Among private collectors the name of Cardinal
Domenico Capranica should be commemorated.
Though continually engaged in war and diplomacy,
he found time to surround himself with books. On
his death in 1458 he gave his palace and library
towards the endowment of a new College at Rome,
and his plans were carried out with some alterations
by his brother Angelo Capranica. Two Greeks of
the imperial House of Lascaris took important places
in the history of the Italian renaissance. Constantine
had found a refuge at Milan after the conquest of his
country, and here he became tutor to the Lady
Hippolyta Sforza, and published a grammar which
was the first book printed in Greek. He afterwards
lectured at Messina, where he formed a large collec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>tion
of <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, which he bequeathed to the citizens.
In a later age it was taken to Spain by Philip <span class="smcap">ii.</span>
and placed on the shelves of the Escorial. John
Lascaris belonged to a younger generation. He
was protected by Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span>, and may be regarded as
the true founder of the Greek College at Rome. In
matters of literature he was the ambassador of
Lorenzo de' M&eacute;dici, and was twice sent to the
Turkish Court in search of books. After the expulsion
of the M&eacute;dici, John Lascaris went to reside in
Paris, where he gave lectures on poetry, and employed
himself in securing Greek lecturers for a new College;
and he was also engaged to help Bud&aelig;us, who had
been his pupil, in arranging the books at Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, had the
largest library in Europe. It was credited with
containing the impossible number of 50,000 volumes;
its destruction during the Turkish wars is allowed to
have been one of the chief misfortunes of literature.
Matthias began his long reign of forty-two years in
1458, and during all that time he was adding to his
collections at Buda. Some have derided Corvinus as
a mere gormandiser with an appetite for all kinds of
books. Some have blamed him for risking such
inestimable treasures upon a dangerous frontier. It
is admitted that he worked hard to dispel the thick
darkness that surrounded the Hungarian people.
He kept thirty scribes continually employed at Buda,
besides four permitted to work at Florence by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
courtesy of Lorenzo de' M&eacute;dici. The whole library
may be regarded as in some sense a Florentine
colony. Fontius, the king's chief agent in the
Levant, had been a well-known author in Florence:
his Commentary upon Persius, once presented to
Corvinus himself, is now in the library at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel.
Attavante, the pupil of Fr&agrave; Angelico, was
employed to illuminate the <span class="smcap">mss</span>. A good specimen
of his work is the Breviary of St. Jerome at Paris,
which came out of the palace at Buda and was
acquired by the nation from the Duc de la Valli&egrave;re.
A traveller named Brassicanus visited Hungary in
the reign of King Louis. He was enraptured with
the grand palace by the river, the tall library buildings
and their stately porticoes. He passes the
galleries under review, and tells us of the huge gold
and silver globes, the instruments of science on the
walls, and an innumerable crowd of well-favoured
and well-clad books. He felt, he assures us, as if he
were in 'Jupiter's bosom,' looking down upon that
'heavenly scene.' He wished that he had brought
away some picture or minute record; but we have
his account of the books which he handled, the Greek
orations that are now lost for ever, the history of
Salvian saved by the King's good nature in presenting
the book to his admiring visitor. The palace and
library were destroyed when Buda was taken by the
Turks. The Pasha in command refused an enormous
sum subscribed for the rescue of the books. The
janissaries tore off the metal coverings from the rarer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">mss.</span>, and tossed the others aside; the only known
copy of Heliodorus, from which all our editions of
the tale of Chariclea are derived, was found in an
open gutter. Some books were burned and others
hacked and maimed, or trodden under foot; many
were carried away into the neighbouring villages.
About four hundred were piled up in a deserted
tower, and were protected against all intrusion by the
seal of the Grand Vizier. There were adventures
still in store for the captives. Through the scattered
villages Dr. Sambucus went up and down, recovering
the strayed Corvinian books for the Emperor
Rodolph, a strange Quixotic figure always riding
alone, with swinging saddle-bags, and a great mastiff
running on either side. Many a disappointed wayfarer
was turned away from the lonely tower. At
last Busbec the great traveller, because he was an
ambassador from the Emperor, was allowed to enter
a kind of charnel-house, and to see what had been the
lovely gaily-painted vellums lying squalidly piled in
heaps. To see them was a high favour; the visitor
was not permitted to touch the remains; and it was
not until 1686 that about forty of the maltreated
volumes were rescued by force of arms and set in a
a place of safety among the Emperor's books at
Vienna.</p>

<p>It has always been a favourite exercise to track
the Corvinian <span class="smcap">mss.</span> into their scattered hiding-places.
Some are in the Vatican, others at Ferrara, and some
in their birth-place at Florence. It is said that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of them have never left their home in Hungary.
Venice possesses a 'History of the House of Corvinus,'
and Jena has a work by Guarini with the King's
insignia 'most delicately painted on the title.' The
portraits of the King and Queen are on one of the
examples secured by Augustus of Brunswick for his
library at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel. Mary of Austria, the widow
of King Louis, presented two of the Corvinian books
to the <i>Librairie de Bourgogne</i> at Brussels; one was
the Missal, full of Attavante's work, on which the
Sovereigns of Brabant were sworn; the other was
the 'Golden Gospels,' long the pride of the Escorial,
but now restored to Belgium.</p>

<p>Other scattered volumes from the library of Corvinus
have been traced to various cities in France and
Germany. There has been much controversy on the
question whether any of them are to be found in
England. Some think that examples might be
traced among the Arundel <span class="smcap">mss.</span> in the British
Museum. Thomas, Earl of Arundel, it is known,
went on a book-hunting expedition to Heidelberg,
where he bought some of the remnants of the Palatine
collection. Passing on to Nuremberg he obtained
about a hundred <span class="smcap">mss.</span> that had belonged to Pirckheimer,
the first great German bibliophile; and these, according
to some authorities, came out of the treasure-house
at Buda. The Duke of Norfolk was persuaded
by John Evelyn to place them in the Gresham
Library, under the care of the Royal Society, and
they afterwards became the property of the nation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Oldys the antiquary distinctly stated that these 'were
the remnants of the King of Hungary'; 'they afterwards
fell into the hands of Bilibald Pirckheimer.'
The Senator of Nuremberg made the books his own
in a very emphatic way: 'there is to be seen his head
graved by Albert D&uuml;rer, one of the first examples of
sticking or pasting of heads, arms, or cyphers into
volumes.' Pirckheimer died in 1530, three years
after the sack of Buda, and had the opportunity of
getting some of the books. We cannot tell to what
extent he succeeded, or whether William Oldys was
right on the facts before him; but we know from
Pirckheimer's own letters that he was the actual owner
of at least some <span class="smcap">mss.</span> that 'came to him out of the
spoils of Hungary.'</p>

<h3>GERMANY&mdash;FLANDERS&mdash;BURGUNDY&mdash;ENGLAND.</h3>


<p>Almost immediately after the invention of printing
in Germany there arose a vast public demand for all
useful kinds of knowledge. The study of Greek was
essential to those who would compete with the Italians
in any of the higher departments of science, and great
schools were established for the purpose by Dringeberg
in a town of Alsace, and by Rudolf Lange at M&uuml;nster.
The Alsatian Academy had the credit of educating
Rhenanus and Bilibald Pirckheimer. Lange filled
his shelves with a quantity of excellent classics that
he had purchased during a tour in Italy. Hermann
Busch, the great critic, was taught in this school, and
he used to say in after life that he often dreamed of
Lange's house, and saw an altar of the Muses surrounded
by the shadowy figures of ancient poets and
orators. Busch was sent afterwards to Deventer,
where he was the class-mate of Erasmus. Here one
day, while the boys were at their themes, came Rudolf
Agricola, the sturdy doctor from Friesland, who
wanted to see a Germany 'more Latin than Latium,'
and had vowed to abate the 'Italian insolence.' The
visitor told Erasmus that he was sure to be a great
man, and patted the young Hermann on the head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
saying that he had the look of a poet; and he is,
indeed, still faintly remembered for the lines in which
he celebrated the triumph of Reuchlin.</p>

<p>Reuchlin had learned Greek at Paris and Poitiers;
at Florence he studied the secrets of the Cabala with
Mirandula; and he perfected his Hebrew at Rome,
where he acted as an envoy from the Elector Palatine.
Reuchlin for many years led a peaceful life at
T&uuml;bingen, an oasis of freedom, in which he could
print or read what he pleased. But in 1509 he was
forced into a quarrel, which involved the whole question
of the liberty of the press, and incidentally associated
the cause of the Reformation with the maintenance
of classical learning.</p>

<p>In the year 1509 one Pfefferkorn, a monk who had
been a convert from Judaism, obtained an imperial
decree that all Hebrew books, except the Scriptures,
should be destroyed. Reuchlin sprang forth to defend
his beloved Cabala, and maintained that only those
volumes ought to be burned which were proved to
have a taint of magic or blasphemy. He was cited
to answer for his heresy before the Grand Inquisitor
at Cologne; and the world, at first indifferent, soon
saw that the cause of the New Learning was at stake.
In the summer of 1514 there was a notable gathering
of Reformers at Frankfort Fair. We have nothing
in our own days that quite resembles these medi&aelig;val
marts; the annual concourse of merchants might perhaps
be compared to one of our industrial exhibitions,
or to some conjunction of all the trade of Leipsic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Nijni Novgorod. The Italians affected to believe
that the Fair by the Main was chiefly taken up with
the sale of mechanical contrivances; the Germans
knew that their 'Attic mart' held streets of book-shops
and publishers' offices. Henri Estienne saw
Professors here from Oxford and Cambridge, from
Louvain, and from Padua: there was a crowd of poets,
historians, and men of science; and he declared that
another Alexandrian Library might be bought in
those seething stalls, if one laid out money like a
king, or like a maniac, as others might say. In this
German Athens a meeting was arranged between
Reuchlin and Erasmus; they were joined at Frankfort
by Hermann Busch, who brought with him the
manuscript of his 'Triumph'; and perhaps it was not
difficult to predict that the cause of the old books
would be safe in the hands of Pope Leo <span class="smcap">x</span>. They
found themselves in company with that ferocious
satirist, Ulric von Hutten, memorable for his threat
to the citizens of Mainz, when they proposed to
destroy his library, and he answered, 'If you burn my
books, I will burn your town.' The Grand Inquisitor
was utterly overwhelmed by his volume of Pasquinades,
a work so witty that it was constantly attributed
to Erasmus, and so carefully destroyed that
Heinsius gave a hundred gold pieces for the copy
which Count Hohendorf afterwards placed among
the imperial rarities at Vienna. The satirist's volume
of <i>Letters from Obscure Men</i> completed the rout of
the Inquisition; and we are told by the way that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
saved the life of Erasmus by throwing him into a
violent fit of laughter.</p>

<p>We do not suppose that many Germans of that day
loved books for their delicate appearance, or the
damask and satin of their 'pleasant coverture.'
Reuchlin may be counted among the bibliophiles,
since he refused a large sum from the Emperor in
lieu of a Hebrew Bible. Melanchthon's books were
rough volumes in stamped pigskin, made valuable by
his marginal notes. The library of Erasmus may be
shown to have been somewhat insignificant by these
words in his will: 'Some time ago I sold my library to
John &agrave; Lasco of Poland, and according to the contract
between us it is to be delivered to him on his paying
two hundred florins to my heir; if he refuses to
accede to this condition, or die before me, my heir is
to dispose of the books as he shall think proper.'
The principal bibliophiles in Germany were the wealthy
Fuggers of Augsburg, of whom Charles <span class="smcap">v.</span> used to
say when he saw any display of magnificence, 'I
have a burgess at Augsburg who can do better than
that.' These merchants were commonly believed to
have discovered the philosopher's stone: they were
in fact enriched by their trade with the East, and had
found another fortune in the quicksilver of Almaden,
by which the gold was extracted from the ores of Peru.
Raimond Fugger amassed a noble library before the
end of the fifteenth century. Ulric his successor was
the friend of Henri Estienne, who proudly announced
himself as printer to the Fuggers on many a title-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>page.
Ulric spent so much money on books that his
family at one time obtained a decree to restrain his
extravagance. His library was said to contain as
many books as there were stars in heaven. The
original stock received a vast accession under his
brother's will, and he purchased another huge collection
formed by Dr. Achilles Gasparus. On his death
he left the whole accumulated mass to the Elector
Palatine, and the books thenceforth shared the
fortunes of the Heidelberg Library. When Tilly
took the city in 1622 the best part of the collection
was offered to the Vatican, and Leo Allatius the
librarian was sent to make the selection, and to
superintend their transport to Rome. The Emperor
Napoleon thought fit to remove some of the <span class="smcap">mss</span>. to
Paris; but, on their being seized by the Allies in
1815, it was thought that prescription should not be
pleaded by Rome: 'especially,' says Hallam, 'when
she was recovering what she had lost by the same
right of spoliation'; and the whole collection of which
the Elector had been deprived was restored to the
library at Heidelberg.</p>

<p>Flanders had been the home of book-learning in
very early times. The Counts of Hainault and the
Dukes of Brabant were patrons of literature when
most of the princes of Europe were absorbed in the
occupations of the chase. The Flemish monasteries
preserved the literary tradition. At Alne, near Li&egrave;ge,
the monks had a Bible which Archdeacon Philip, the
friend of St. Bernard, had transcribed before the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
1140. We hear of another at Louvain, about a century
later in date, with initials in blue and gold throughout,
which had taken three years in copying. Deventer
was known as 'the home of Minerva' before the days
of St. Thomas &agrave; Kempis. The Forest of Soigny
provided a retreat for learning in its houses of Val-Rouge
and Val-Vert and the Sept-Fontaines. The
Brothers of the Common Life had long been engaged
in the production of books before they gave themselves
to the labours of the printing-press at Brussels.
Thomas &agrave; Kempis himself has described their way of
living at Deventer. 'Much was I delighted,' he said,
'with the devout conversation, the irreproachable
demeanour and humility of the brethren: I had never
seen such piety and charity: they took no concern
about what passed outside, but remained at home,
employed in prayer and study, or in copying useful
books.' This work at good books, he repeated, is the
opening of the fountains of life: 'Blessed are the
hands of the copyists: for which of the world's
writings would be remembered, if there had been no
pious hand to transcribe them?' He himself during
his stay at Deventer copied out a Bible, a Missal, and
four of St. Bernard's works, and when he went to
Zwolle he composed and wrote out a chronicle of the
brotherhood.</p>

<p>The Abbey of St. Bavon at Ghent was endowed
with a great number of books by Rafael de Mercatellis,
the reputed son of Philippe le Bon, Duke of Burgundy.
As Abbot he devoted his life to increasing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
splendour of his monastery. The illuminated <span class="smcap">mss</span>.
survived the perils of war and the excesses of the
Revolution, and are still to be seen in the University
with the Abbot's signature on their glittering title-pages.</p>

<p>A more important collection belonged to Louis de
Bruges, Seigneur de La Gruthuyse. As titular Earl
of Winchester he was in some degree connected with
this country. When Edward <span class="smcap">iv.</span> fled from England,
and was chased by German pirates, this nobleman
was Governor of Holland. He rescued the
fugitives, and paid their expenses; and when Edward
recovered his throne he rewarded his friend with a
title and a charge on the Customs. The dignity
carried no active privileges, and in 1499 it was
surrendered to the King at Calais. The books of La
Gruthuyse have been described as 'the bibliographical
marvel of the age.' They were celebrated for
their choice vellum, their delicate penmanship, and
their exquisite illustrations. Louis de Bruges was
the friend and patron of Colard Mansion, who printed
in partnership with Caxton. Three copies are known
of his work called the 'Penitence of Adam.' One
belonged to the Royal Library of France: another
was borrowed from a monastery by the Duc d'Isenghien,
an enthusiastic but somewhat unscrupulous
collector, and this copy was sold at the Gaignat sale
in 1769; the third was the property of M. Lambinet
of Brussels, and is remarkable for the miniature in
which Mansion is represented as offering the book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to his patron in the garden of La Gruthuyse. After
the death of Louis his books passed to his son Jean de
Bruges; but most of them were soon afterwards
acquired by Louis <span class="smcap">xii.</span>, who added them to the
library at Blois, the insignia of La Gruthuyse being
replaced by the arms of France. Others were
bequeathed to Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> by the bibliophile Hippolyte
de B&eacute;thune, who refused a magnificent offer
from Queen Christina of Sweden in order that his
books might remain in France. A fine copy of the
<i>Forteresse du Foy</i> belonged to Claude d'Urf&eacute;, whose
library of 4000 books, 'all in green velvet,' was
kept in his castle at La Bastie; when all the others
were dispersed the Gruthuyse volume remained as an
heirloom, and descended to Honor&eacute; d'Urf&eacute;, the
dreariest of all writers of romance. In 1776 it belonged
to the Duc de la Valli&egrave;re, and was purchased
for the French Government at one of his numerous
sales. Some of the Flemish books remained in their
original home. A volume of Wallon songs was
discovered at Ghent in the last generation; and two
other Gruthuyse books in the same language, from
the great collection of M. Van Hulthem, are now
deposited in the Burgundian Library at Brussels.</p>

<p>The Dukes of Burgundy were of the book-loving
race of the Valois. The brothers, Charles le Sage,
Jean Duc de Berry, and Philippe le Hardi of Burgundy,
were all founders of celebrated libraries. Philippe
increased his store of books by his marriage with the
heiress of Flanders; he kept a large staff of scribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at work, and made incessant purchases from the
Lombard booksellers in Paris. Duke John, his
successor, is remembered for his acquisition of a
wonderful <i>Valerius Maximus</i> from the librarian of
the Sorbonne. But the collections of which the
remnants are now preserved in Belgium were almost
entirely the work of Duke Philippe le Bon. He kept
his books in many different places. He had a library
at Dijon, and another in Paris, a few volumes in the
treasury at Ghent, a thousand volumes at Bruges,
and nearly as many at Antwerp. It has been calculated
that he possessed more than 3200 <span class="smcap">mss.</span> in all;
and, if that figure is correct, the House of Bourgogne-Valois
was in this respect almost the richest of the
reigning families of Europe.</p>

<p>Under Charles the Bold the libraries appear to have
been left alone, except as regards a few characteristic
additions. The Duchess Margaret was the patroness
of her countryman Caxton, whose <i>Recuyell</i>, probably
published at Bruges in 1474 during his partnership
with Colard Mansion, was the first printed English
book. The taste of the Duchess may answer for the
appearance in the library of the <i>Moral Discourses</i>,
and the elegant <i>Debates upon Happiness</i>. The <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i>
and the romance of <i>Quintus Curtius</i> must
be attributed to the warlike Duke. At Berne they
have a relic of the fight where his men were shot
down 'like ducks in the reeds.' It is a manuscript,
with a note added to the following effect: 'These
military ordinances of the excellent and invincible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Duke Charles of Burgundy were taken at Morat on
the 14th of June 1476, being found in the pavilion of
that excellent and potent prince.' When Charles was
killed at Nancy in the following year his favourite
<i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i> was found by the Swiss in his baggage.
This volume was bought in 1833 by the Queen of the
Belgians at a book-sale in Paris, and has now been
restored to its original home at Brussels.</p>

<p>After the death of Charles the Bold his library at
Dijon was given by the French King to George de la
Tremouille, the governor of the province. It passed
to the family of Guy de Rocheford, and in the course
of time many of the best works have found their way
into the national collection. Mary of Burgundy
retained the other libraries at Brussels. After her
marriage with Maximilian her family treasures were
for the most part dispersed in France, Germany,
and Sweden, the needy prince being unable to resist
the temptation of pilfering and pawning the books;
but the generosity of Margaret of Austria, a great
collector herself of fine copies and first editions, in
some measure repaired the loss; and Mary of Austria,
who became Regent in 1530, continued the work of
restoration.</p>

<p>The magnificence of the Burgundian Court and the
commercial prosperity of the Low Countries led to a
continuous demand for fine books among the other
productions of luxury. We learn also by the Venetian
Archives that throughout the fifteenth century books
were being imported into England by the galleys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that brought the produce of the East to our merchants
in London and Southampton. There were as yet
but slight signs of literary activity; but it has been
well said that 'the seed was germinating in the
ground'; and many foreign works were brought home
from time to time by those who had studied or
travelled in Italy. It was the fashion of the day to
learn under Guarini at Ferrara; the list of his
scholars includes the names of Robert Fleming, and
Bishop William Gray, and the book-loving John
Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, whose virtue and learning
became the object of William Caxton's celebrated
eulogy. We may commemorate here the earlier
labours of Lord Cobham, who caused Wicliffe's works
to be copied at a great expense and to be conveyed
for safety to Bohemia, and of Sir Walter Sherington,
who early in the same century built a library at
Glastonbury, and furnished it with 'fair books upon
vellum.' Towards the end of the century learning
began to flourish under the patronage of Lord Saye,
and the accomplished Anthony Lord Rivers: and
its future in this country was secure, when the English
scholars began to flock towards Florence to hear the
lectures of Chalcondylas and his successor Politian.
Grocyn, our first Greek Professor, had drawn his
learning from that source, and Linacre had sat there
in a class with the children of Lorenzo de' M&eacute;dici.
Cardinal Pole and the Ciceronian De Longueil shared
as students in those tasks and sports at Padua which
were so vividly described by the English churchman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in his record of their life-long friendship. Thomas
Lilly, the master at St. Paul's, not only worked at
Florence but went to perfect his Greek in the Isle of
Rhodes. Sir Thomas More was the pupil of Grocyn,
whom he seems to have excelled in scholarship. His
affection for books is known by his son-in-law's careful
biography. An anecdote cited by Dibdin preserves
a record of the fate of his library. When the
Chancellor was arrested, the officers were expected to
listen to his talk with certain spies, on the chance
that the prisoner might be led into a treasonable conversation;
but, as Mr. Palmer said in his deposition,
'he was so busy trussing up Sir Thomas More's books
in a sack that he took no heed to their talk'; and
Sir Richard Southwell on the same occasion deposed,
that 'being appointed only to look to the conveyance
of the books, he gave no ear unto them.' Erasmus
praised More as 'the most gentle soul ever framed by
Nature.' He was astonished at his learning, and indeed
at the high standard that had already been
attained in England. 'It is incredible,' he said, 'what
a thick crop of old books spreads out on every side:
there is so much erudition, not of any ordinary kind,
but recondite and accurate and antique, both in Greek
and Latin, that you need not go to Italy except for the
pleasure of travelling.' Hallam remarked that Erasmus
was always ready with a compliment; but he admitted
that before the year 1520 there were probably
more scholars in England than in France, 'though all
together they might not weigh as heavy as Bud&aelig;us.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>FRANCE: EARLY BOOKMEN&mdash;ROYAL COLLECTORS.</h3>


<p>We shall take Bud&aelig;us as our first example of the
French bookmen in the period that followed the
invention of printing. Of Guillaume Bud&eacute;, to give
him his original name, it was said that he knew Greek
as minutely as the orators of the age of Demosthenes.
If there was any real foundation for the compliment
it must have consisted in the fact that the Frenchman
had more acquaintance with the language than his
instructor George of Sparta. Bud&aelig;us is said to have
paid a very large sum for a course of lectures on
Homer, and to have been not a pennyworth the wiser
at the end. Erasmus, who also learned of the
Spartan, confessed that his tutor only 'stammered in
Greek,' and that he seemed to have neither the desire
nor the capacity for teaching. It is interesting to see
how these students made the best of their bad
materials. 'I have given my whole soul to Greek,'
wrote Erasmus, 'and as soon as I get any money I
shall buy books first, and then some clothes.' Bud&aelig;us
was known as 'the prodigy of France,' and even
Scaliger allowed that his country would never see
such a scholar again; and it is rather surprising that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Erasmus should have compared his style unfavourably
with that of Badius, the printer from Brabant.</p>

<p>Bud&aelig;us was the first to apply the historical method
to the explanation of the Civil Law: with the assistance
of Jean Grolier he brought out a very learned
treatise on ancient weights and measures; and in
publishing his commentaries on the Greek language
he was said to have raised himself to 'a pinnacle of
philological glory.' One of the stories about his
devotion to books may have been told of others, but
is certainly characteristic of the man. A servant
rushes in to say that the house is on fire; but the
scholar answers, 'Tell my wife: you know that I
never interfere with the household.' He was married
twice over, he used to say, to the Muse of philology
as well as to a mortal wife; but he confessed that he
would never have got far with the first, if the second
had not commanded in the library, always ready to
look out passages and to hand down the necessary
books.</p>

<p>When Charles <span class="smcap">viii.</span> seized the royal library at
Naples, a few of the best <span class="smcap">mss.</span> escaped his scrutiny,
and these were sold by the dispossessed King to the
Cardinal D'Amboise. A new school of illuminators
at Rouen provided the Cardinal with a number of
other splendid volumes. He lived till the year 1510,
and was able to collect a second library of printed
books. He divided the whole into two portions at
his death, the French books passing to a relation and
afterwards to the family of La Rochefoucauld, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the rest forming the foundation of a fine library long
possessed by the Archbishops of Rouen.</p>

<p>The Archbishop Juvenal des Ursins died in the
middle of the fifteenth century. He is celebrated as a
lover of good books, though only a single example of
his choice survived into the present generation. It
was a magnificent missal on vellum, filled with the
choicest miniatures, and known as the best specimen
of its class in the possession of Prince Soltikoff. It is
only a few years ago that it entered the collection of
M. Firmin-Didot, who paid 36,000 francs for it at the
Prince's sale: in the year 1861 he gave it up to the
City of Paris; but like so many of the great books of
France it perished in the fires of the Commune.</p>

<p>Jacques de Pars, the physician to Charles <span class="smcap">vii.</span>,
bequeathed his scientific <span class="smcap">mss.</span> to the College of
Medicine at Paris: and the value of his gift was
manifested when the powerful Louis <span class="smcap">xi.</span> was forbidden
to take out a medical treatise for transcription
unless he would pledge his silver plate and find
collateral security for its safe return. &Eacute;tienne
Chevalier was one of the few servants of King Charles
who were tolerated by King Louis. He became
Chief Treasurer to Louis <span class="smcap">xi.</span>, and built a great
mansion in the Rue de la Verrerie in Paris. The
walls and ceilings were decorated with allegorical
designs in honour of his friend Agn&egrave;s Sorel, whose
courage had led to the expulsion of the English invaders.
The library was filled with choice <span class="smcap">mss.</span>,
illuminated for the most part by Jehan Foucquet, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
famous miniaturist from Tours. Nicholas Chevalier,
his descendant in the sixteenth century, was also
illustrious as a bibliophile, and amidst his own printed
folios and pedigrees rolled in blue velvet could still
show the marvellous <i>Livre d'Heures</i>, of which all that
now remains is a set of paintings hacked out from the
text. M. Le Roux de Lincy has compiled a long and
interesting list of the French bibliophiles who preceded
the age of Grolier. We can only mention a
few out of the number. Of the poets we have Charles,
Duke of Orl&eacute;ans, the owner of eighty magnificent
volumes preserved in the Castle of Blois, and Pierre
Ronsard; and we may add the Abb&eacute; Philippe Desportes,
renowned not less for a rivalry with Ronsard
than for his sumptuous mode of living and the fortune
expended on his library. To the statesmen may be
added Florimond Robertet, the first of a long line of
bibliophiles. Among the learned ladies of the sixteenth
century we may choose Louise Lab&eacute;, surnamed
'La Belle Cordi&egrave;re,' who made a collection of a new
kind, composed entirely of works in French, Spanish,
and Italian, and Charlotte Guillard, a printer as well
as a book-collector, who published at her own expense
a volume of the Commentaries of St. Jerome.</p>

<p>The most important of the private collectors in this
period was Arthur Gouffier, Seigneur de Boissy,
another of the faithful followers of Charles <span class="smcap">vii.</span> who
were so fortunate as to gain the confidence of his
jealous successor.</p>

<p>He was a lover of fine bindings in the style ren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>dered
famous by Grolier. One of his books belonged
to the late Baron J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Pichon, the head of the
French <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bibliophiles</i>, and it is admitted that
nothing even in Grolier's library could excel it in
delicacy of execution. His son, Claude Gouffier,
created Duc de Rouannais, was a collector of an
essentially modern type. He bought autographs
and historical portraits, as well as rare <span class="smcap">mss.</span> and good
specimens of printing, and was careful to have his
books well clothed in the fashionable painted binding.
Claude Gouffier was tutor to the young Duc
d'Angoul&ecirc;me, who came to the throne as Francis <span class="smcap">i.</span>;
and to him may be due his royal pupil's affection
for the books bedecked with the salamander in flames
and the silver <i>fleurs-de-lys</i>.</p>

<p>Francis <span class="smcap">i.</span> cared little for printed books in comparison
with manuscript rarities; he added very few
to the collection at Fontainebleau beyond what he
received as presents from his mother, Queen Louise,
and his sister Marguerite d'Angoul&ecirc;me. The royal
library owed many of its finest manuscripts to the
delicate taste of the princess who was compared to
the 'blossom of poetry' and praised as the 'Marguerite
des Marguerites.' Its wealth was much increased by
the confiscation of the property of the Constable de
Bourbon; and it should be remembered that among
the additions from this source were most of the
magnificently illuminated manuscripts that had belonged
to Jean Duc de Berri.</p>

<p>The King was much attracted by the hope of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
making literary discoveries in the East; he obtained
much information on the subject from John Lascaris,
and despatched Pierre Gilles to make purchases in
the Levantine monasteries. A similar commission
was entrusted to Guillaume Postel, one of the greatest
linguists that ever lived, but so crazy that he believed
himself to be Adam born to live again, and so unfortunate
that he could seldom keep out of a prison.</p>

<p>The reign of Henri Deux is of great importance
in the annals of bibliography. An ordinance was
made in 1558, through the influence, as it is supposed,
of Diane de Poitiers, by which every publisher was
compelled to present copies of his books, printed on
vellum and suitably bound, to the libraries at Blois
and Fontainebleau, and such others as the King
should appoint. About eight hundred volumes in
the national collection represent the immediate results
of this copy-tax; they are all marked with the ambiguous
cypher, which might either represent the
initials of the King and Queen or might indicate the
names of Henri and Diane. Queen Catherine de
M&eacute;dici was an enthusiastic collector. When she
arrived in France as a girl she brought with her
from Urbino a number of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> that had belonged to
the Eastern Emperors, and had been purchased by
Cosmo de' M&eacute;dici. She afterwards seized the whole
library of Marshal Strozzi on the ground that they
must be regarded as 'M&eacute;dici books,' having been
inherited at one time by a nephew of Leo <span class="smcap">x.</span>
On her death in 1589 she was found to have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
possessed of about eight hundred Greek manuscripts,
all of the highest rarity and value. There was some
danger that they would be seized by her creditors;
but the King was advised that such an assemblage
could not be got together again in any country or
at any cost. The library was made an heir-loom of
the Crown: and at De Thou's suggestion the books
were stripped of their rich coverings and disguised
in an official costume.</p>

<p>Diane de Poitiers, a true <i>chasseresse des bouquins</i>,
was herself the daughter of a bibliophile. The Comte
de St. Vallier loved books in Italian bindings, and
there is a <i>Roman de Perceforest</i> in the collection of the
Duc d'Aumale, that bears the Saint Vallier arms and
marks of ownership, though it was confidently believed
to have been bound for Grolier when it belonged
to King Louis-Philippe. Henri Deux and
the Duchesse Diane kept a treasure of books between
them in the magnificent castle of Anet: and after
they were dead the books remained unknown and
unnoticed in their hall until the death of the Princesse
de Cond&eacute; in the year 1723. The sale which then
took place was a revelation of beauty. The books
were in good condition, and were all clad in sumptuous
bindings. There was a remarkable diversity in
their contents, the Fathers and the poets standing side
by side with treatises upon medicine and the management
of a household, as if they had been acquired in
great part by virtue of the tax upon the publishers.
Most of them, we are told, were bought by the 'in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>trepid
book-hunter' M. Guyon de Sardi&egrave;res, whose
whole library in its turn was engulphed in the miscellaneous
collections of the Duc de la Valli&egrave;re. An
article in the <i>Bibliophile Fran&ccedil;ais</i> contains a curious
argument in favour of Diane de Poitiers, as being one
of a band of devoted Frenchwomen who saved their
country from foreign ideas. We are reminded of
the patriotism of Agn&egrave;s Sorel, and of the excellent
influence of Gabrielle d'Estr&eacute;es. The Duchesse
d'Estampes, we are told, preserved Francis <span class="smcap">i.</span> from
the influence of the Italian renaissance, and prevented
the subjugation of France 'by a Benvenuto or Da
Vinci'; and in the same way, when Catherine de
M&eacute;dici was preparing to introduce other strange
fashions, Diane came forward in her 'magical beauty'
and saved the originality of her nation.</p>

<p>The three sons of Catherine were all fond of
books in their way. Francis <i>ii.</i> died before he had
time to make any collection; if he had lived, Mary
of Scotland, who shared his throne for a few weeks,
might have led him into the higher paths of literature.
Some of their favourite volumes have been preserved;
the young King's books bear the dolphin or the arms of
France; the Queen bound everything in black morocco
emblasoned with the lion of Scotland. Charles <span class="smcap">ix.</span>
had a turn for literature, as beseemed the pupil
of Bishop Amyot; he studied arch&aelig;ology in some
detail, and purchased Grolier's cabinet of coins.
He brought the library of Fontainebleau to Paris,
where his father had made the beginning of a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
collection out of the confiscated property of the Pr&eacute;sident
Ranconnet, and gave the management of the
whole to the venerable Amyot. His brother, the
effeminate Henri Trois, cared much for bindings and
little for books: it is said that he was somewhat of
a book-binder himself, as his brother Charles had
worked at the armourer's smithy, and as some of his
successors were to take up the technicalities of the
barber, the cook, and the locksmith. Being an extravagant
idler himself, he passed laws against extravagance
in his subjects; but though furs and heavy
chains might be forbidden, he allowed gilt edges and
arabesques on books, and only drew the line at massive
gold stamps. His own taste combined the
gloomy and the grotesque, his clothes and his
bindings alike being covered with skulls and cross-bones,
and spangles to represent tears, with other
conventional emblems of sorrow.</p>

<p>Louise of Lorraine, after the King's death, retired to
the castle of Chenonceau: and the widowed queen
employed her time, in that 'palace of fairy-land,' at
forming a small cabinet of books. The catalogue
describes about eighty volumes, mostly bound by
Nicolas Eve; and the gay morocco covers in red,
blue, and green, were decorated with brilliant arabesques,
or sprinkled with golden lilies. Hardly any
perfect specimens remain, even in the National
Library. They were all bequeathed by the Queen
to her niece the Duchesse de Vend&ocirc;me; but in the
hands of a later possessor they were put up for sale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and dispersed, and have now for the most part disappeared.</p>

<p>Henri Quatre is said to have fled to his books for
consolation when abandoned by Gabrielle d'Estr&eacute;es.
Though no bibliophile himself, he was anxious that
everything should be done that could promote the
interests of literature. He intended to establish a
magnificent library in the Coll&egrave;ge de Cambray, but
died before the plans were completed. The books at
Blois, however, were brought to Paris and thrown
open to deserving students; the library already
transported from Fontainebleau and the <span class="smcap">mss.</span> of
Catherine de M&eacute;dici were removed to the Coll&egrave;ge
de Clermont, and placed under the guardianship of
De Thou.</p>

<p>Marguerite de Valois agreed with the King, if in
nothing else, at least in a desire for the extension of
knowledge. She was a most learned lady as well as
a collector of exquisite books. No branch of science,
sacred or profane, came amiss to the 'Reine Margot.'
She may be regarded as the Queen of the 'Femmes
Bibliophiles' who occupied so important a position in
the history of the Court of France. In the domain
of good taste she excels all competitors; as regards
intellect we can hardly estimate the distance between
Marguerite and the elegant collectors whom we
distinguish according to the names of their book-binders.
Anne of Austria is remembered for the
lace-like patterns of Le Gascon; and Queen Marie
Leczinska is famous for the splendour of her volumes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
bound by Padeloup. Even the libraries of the
daughters of Louis Quinze, three diligent and well-instructed
princesses, are only known apart by the
colours of the moroccos employed by Der&ocirc;me. The
dull contents of the Pompadour's shelves would hardly
be noticeable without her 'three castles,' or the 'ducal
mantle,' by Biziaux; and no one but Louis Quinze
himself would have praised the intelligent choice of
Du Barry, or cast a look upon her collection of odd
volumes and 'remainders,' if they had not been decorated
like the rest of her furniture. In all the lists of
these 'ladies of old-time' by M. Guigard, by M.
Quentin-Bauchart, or by M. Uzanne, it is difficult to
find one who preferred the inside to the outside of the
book. M. Uzanne, indeed, has contended that no
female bibliophile ever felt the passion that inspired a
Grolier or a De Thou: that Marie Antoinette herself
may have caged thousands of books at the Trianon
like birds in an aviary, without any real regard to
their nature or the right way of using them; that
these devotees of the book-chase were like an invalid
master of hounds, keeping the pack in a gilded
kennel without any exercise or any chance of
practical work. We think that something perhaps
might be said on the other side. The Duchesse de
Berry in our own time possessed a serious collection,
made under her own direction, in which might be
found the <i>Livre d'Heures</i> of Henri Deux, the prayer-book
of Joanna of Naples, the best books of Marguerite
de Valois and Marie Leczinska. The Princess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Pauline Buonaparte was the owner of a well-selected
library. But our best example is Madame Elisabeth,
the ill-fated daughter of France, who was dragged
from her books at Montreuil in the tumults of 1789.
Only a short time before she had been absorbed in
her simple collection. In the spring of 1786 she gave
up her mornings to its arrangement. 'My library,'
she wrote, 'is nearly finished: the desks are being
put up, and you cannot imagine the fine effect of the
books.' On September the 15th she writes to her
friend again: 'Montreuil and its mistress get on as
well as two sweethearts. I am writing in the small
room at the end; the books are settled in their
shelves, and my library is really a little gem.' On
the 5th of October she was standing on the terrace
by the library-window, when she saw a crowd coming
along the S&egrave;vres road, and heard the noise of pipes
and drums; and on the same day she was forced to
leave Montreuil, and never saw her books again.</p>

<h3>THE OLD ROYAL LIBRARY&mdash;FAIRFAX&mdash;COTTON&mdash;HARLEY&mdash;THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.</h3>


<p>Henry <span class="smcap">vii.</span> was the founder of a royal collection
which in time became a constituent portion of
the library at the British Museum. Careful as he
was of his money, the King endeavoured to buy every
book published in French, and he acquired the whole
of V&eacute;rard's series of classics, printed on vellum with
initials in gold and gorgeous illuminations, in some
of which the printer is shown presenting his books
to the royal collector. Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span> established the
separate library which was long maintained at St.
James's; he intended it mainly for the education
of princes of the blood royal, and supplied it with a
quantity of early-printed books and a miscellaneous
gathering of wreckage from the monasteries. During
several succeeding reigns there were 'studies' and
galleries of books at Whitehall and Windsor Castle,
at Greenwich and Oatlands, or wherever the Court
might be held. It is said that in the time of
Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span> the best English collection belonged to
Bishop Fisher. 'He had the notablest library,' said
Fuller, 'two long galleries full, the books sorted in
stalls, and a register of the name of each book at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
end of its stall.' This great storehouse of knowledge
the Bishop had intended to transfer to St. John's
College at Cambridge; but on his disgrace it was
seized by Thomas Cromwell and dispersed among
his greedy retainers.</p>

<p>Under the Protector Somerset the Protestant feeling
ran high. Martin Bucer's manuscripts were
bought for the young King; and the Reformer's
printed books were divided between Archbishop
Cranmer and the Duchess of Somerset. About the
same time an order was issued in the name of
Edward <span class="smcap">vi.</span> for purging the King's library at Westminster
of missals, legends, and other 'superstitious
volumes'; and their 'garniture,' according to the
fashion of the time, was bestowed as a perquisite
upon a grasping courtier.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/08.jpg"><img src="./images/08_th.jpg" alt="BINDING EXECUTED FOR QUEEN ELIZABETH." title="BINDING EXECUTED FOR QUEEN ELIZABETH." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">BINDING EXECUTED FOR QUEEN ELIZABETH.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was naturally fond of fine books.
She had a small collection before she reached the throne,
and became in due course the recipient of a number
of splendid presentation volumes. There is a copy of
a French poem in her praise in the public library at
Oxford: its pages are full of exquisite portraits and
designs, and on the sides there are 'brilliant bosses
composed of humming-birds' feathers.' As a child
she had bound her books in needle-work, or in
'blue corded silk, with gold and silver thread,' in the
style afterwards adopted by the sisters at Little
Gidding in the time of Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span> Her Testament,
most carefully covered by her own handiwork,
contains a note quoted by Mr. Macray in his 'Annals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the Bodleian Library'; it refers to her walks in
the field of Scripture, where she plucked up the
'goodlie greene herbes,' which she afterwards ate by
her reading, 'and chawed by musing.' Her gallery
at Whitehall made a gallant show of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> and
classics in red velvet, with gilt clasps and jewelled
sides, and all the French and Italian books standing
by in morocco and gold. Archbishop Parker tried
to induce her to establish a national library; but the
Queen seems to have cared little about the plan.
She allowed the Archbishop on his own behalf to
seek out the books remaining from the suppressed
monasteries: at another time he obtained leave to
recover as many as he could find of Cranmer's books.
He tracked some of them to the house of one Dr.
Nevinson, who was forced to disgorge his treasures.
Parker kept a staff of scribes and painters in miniature,
and had his own press and fount of type. He
published many scarce tracts to save them from
oblivion. Others he ordered to be copied in manuscript,
and these and all his ancient books he caused
to be 'trimly covered'; so that we may say with
Dibdin, 'a more determined book-fancier existed not
in Great Britain.' He gave some of his books to
'his nurse Corpus Christi' at Cambridge, and some
to the public library; and his gift to the College was
compared to 'the sun of our English antiquity,'
eclipsed only by the shadow of Cotton's palace of
learning.</p>

<p>One would like to fancy a symposium of the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
men talking over their books, in the room where Ben
Jonson was king, and where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Mellifluous Shakespeare, whose enchanting quill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commanded mirth and passion, was but Will.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jonson's books, as was said of himself, were like
the great Spanish galleons, bulky folios with '<i>Sum
Ben Jonson</i>' boldly inscribed. We know little about
Shakespeare's books, except that they probably went
to the New Place and passed among the chattels to
Susanna Hall and her husband. His Florio's version
of Montaigne is in the British Museum, if the authenticity
of his signature can be trusted. His neat Aldine
Ovid is at the Bodleian, inscribed with his initials, and
a note: 'this little booke of Ovid was given to me by
W. Hall, who sayd it was once Will Shakspere's.'</p>

<p>We would call to our meeting Gabriel Harvey
with his new Italian books and pamphlets; and
Spenser, if possible, should be there; Dr. Dee
would tell the piteous story of his four thousand
volumes, printed and unprinted, Greek, in French,
and High-Dutch <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, etc., and of forty years
spent in gathering the books that were all on their
way to the pawnshop. He might have told the
fortunes of all the books with the help of his magical
mirrors and crystals. Francis Bacon's store was to
increase and multiply, to adorn the library at Cambridge
and fill the shelves at Gray's Inn; Lord
Leicester's books, with their livery of the 'bear and
ragged staff,' were to freeze for ages in the galleries
at Lambeth. We should have Ascham inveighing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
against the ancients and their idle and blind way of
living: 'in our father's time,' he says, 'nothing was
read but books of feigned chivalry'; but Captain
Cox would come forth to meet him, attired as in the
tournament at Kenilworth, or in the picture which
Dibdin has extracted from Laneham. 'Captain Cox
came marching on, clean trussed and gartered above
the knee, all fresh in a velvet cap: an odd man, I
promise you: by profession a mason, and that right
skilful and very cunning in fence.... As for King
Arthur and Huon of Bourdeaux, ... the Fryar and
the Boy, Elynor Rumming, and the Nut-brown Maid,
with many more than I can rehearse, I believe he has
them all at his fingers' ends.'</p>

<p>James <span class="smcap">i.</span>, as became a 'Solomon,' was the
master of many books; but not being a 'fancier' he
gave them shabby coverings and scribbled idle notes
on their margins. He is forgiven for being a pedant,
since Buchanan said it was the best that could be
made of him; it is difficult to be patient about his
hint to the Dutch that it would be well to burn the
old scholar Vorstius instead of making him a professor
at Leyden. He seems to have done more harm
than good to the libraries in his own possession.
We know how he broke into a 'noble speech'
when he visited Bodley at Oxford, with the librarian
trembling lest the King should see a book by
Buchanan, who had often whipped his royal pupil in
days gone by: 'If I were not a King I would be an
University-man, and if it was so that I must be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
prisoner I would desire no other durance than to be
chained in that library with so many noble authors.'</p>

<p>The King gave Sir Thomas Bodley a warrant
under the Privy Seal to take what books he pleased
from any of the royal palaces and libraries; 'howbeit,'
said Bodley, 'for that the place at Whitehall is over
the Queen's chamber, I must needs attend her
departure from thence, whereof at present there is
no certainty known: how I shall proceed for other
places I have not yet resolved.'</p>

<p>Prince Henry had a more refined taste. The
dilettanti of the Prince's set took no part in the
drunken antics of the Court, where Goring was master
of the games, but Sir John Millicent 'made the best
<i>extempore</i> fool.' The Prince bought almost the whole
of the monastic library originally formed by Henry
Lord Arundel: about forty volumes had already
been given by Lord Lumley to Oxford.</p>

<p>There was some danger that the books at Whitehall
would be destroyed in the fury of the Civil War;
but almost all of them were saved by the personal
exertions of Hugh Peters, when Selden had told him
that there was not the like of these rare monuments
in Christendom, outside the Vatican. Whitelocke
was appointed their keeper, and to his deputy, John
Dury, we owe the first English treatise on library
management. Thomas, Lord Fairfax, did a similar
good service at Oxford. When the city was surrended
in 1646 the first thing that the General did
was to place a guard of soldiers at the Bodleian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
There was more hurt done by the Cavaliers, said
Aubrey, in the way of embezzlement and cutting the
chains off the books, than was ever done afterwards.
Fairfax, he adds, was himself a lover of learning, and
had he not taken this special care the library would
have been destroyed; 'for there were ignorant
senators enough who would have been content
to have it so.' As a rule, we must admit that the
Puritans were friendly to literature, with a very
natural exception as to merely ecclesiastical records.
Oliver Cromwell gave some of the Barocci <span class="smcap">mss.</span> to
the University of Oxford; and the preservation of
Usher's library at Trinity College, Dublin, was due
to the public spirit of the Cromwellian soldiers,
officers and men having subscribed alike for its
purchase 'out of emulation to a former noble action
of Queen Elizabeth's army in Ireland.'</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/09.jpg"><img src="./images/09_th.jpg" alt="SIR ROBERT COTTON." title="SIR ROBERT COTTON." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">SIR ROBERT COTTON.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Cotton began about 1588 to gather
materials for a history of England. With the help of
Camden and Sir Henry Spelman he obtained nearly
a thousand volumes of records and documents; and
these he arranged under a system, by which they are
still cited, in fourteen wainscot presses marked with
the names of the twelve C&aelig;sars, Cleopatra, and
Faustina. He was so rich in State Papers that, as
Fuller said, 'the fountains were fain to fetch water
from the stream,' and the secretaries and clerks of
the Council were glad in many cases to borrow
back valuable originals. Sir Robert was at one time
accused of selling secrets to the Spanish ambassador,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and various excuses were found for closing the library,
until at last it was declared to be unfit for public
use on account of its political contents. He often
told his friends that this tyranny had broken his
heart, and shortly before his death in 1631 he informed
the Lords of the Council that their conduct was the
cause of his mortal malady. The library was restored
to his son Sir Thomas: and in Sir John Cotton's time
the public made a considerable use of its contents;
but it seems to have been still a matter of favour, for
Burnet complains that he was refused admittance
unless he could procure a recommendation from the
Archbishop and the Secretary of State. Anthony
Wood gives a pleasant account of his visit: 'Posting
off forthwith he found Sir John Cotton in his house,
joining almost to Westminster Hall: he was then
practising on his lute, and when he had done he came
out and received Wood kindly, and invited him to
dinner, and directed him to Mr. Pearson who kept
the key. Here was another trouble; for the said Mr.
Pearson being a lodger in the shop of a bookseller
living in Little Britain, Wood was forced to walk
thither, and much ado there was to find him.' The
library was afterwards moved to Essex Street, and
then to Ashburnham House in Little Dean's Yard,
where the great fire took place in 1731, which some
attributed to 'Dr. Bentley's villainy.' Dean Stanley
has told us how the Headmaster of Westminster,
coming to the rescue, saw a figure issue from the
burning house, 'in his dressing-gown, with a flowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
wig on his head, and a huge volume under his arm.'
This was Dr. Bentley the librarian, doing his best to
save the Alexandrian <span class="smcap">ms.</span> of the New Testament.
Mr. Speaker Onslow and some of the other trustees
worked hard in the crowd at pumping, breaking open
the presses, and throwing the volumes out at a
window. The destruction was lamentable; but
wonders have been done in extending the shrivelled
documents and rendering their ashes legible. The
public use of the collection had been already regulated
by Parliament when a comprehensive Act was passed
in 1753, and the nation acquired under one title the
Cottonian Library, Sir Hans Sloane's Museum, the
Earl of Oxford's pamphlets and manuscripts, and all
that remained of the ancient royal collections.</p>

<p>Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, made a great
purchase in 1705, and spent the next twenty years in
building on that foundation. His son, Earl Edward,
threw himself with zeal into the undertaking, and left
at his death about 50,000 books, besides a huge body
of manuscripts and an incredible number of pamphlets.
We shall quote from the sketch by Oldys, who shared
with Dr. Johnson the task of compiling the catalogue.
'The Earl had the rarest books of all countries,
languages, and sciences': thousands of fragments,
some a thousand years old: vellum books, of which
some had been scraped and used again as 'palimpsests':
'a great collection of Bibles, and editions of
all the first printed books, classics, and others of our
own country, ecclesiastical as well as civil, by Caxton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, Berthelet, Rastall,
Grafton, and the greatest number of pamphlets and
English heads of any other person: abundance of
ledgers, chartularies, etc., and original letters of
eminent persons as many as would fill two hundred
volumes; all the collections of his librarian Humphrey
Wanley, of Stow, Sir Symonds D'Ewes, Prynne,
Bishop Stillingfleet, John Bagford, Le Neve, and the
flower of a hundred other libraries.'</p>

<p>A few of these collections ought to be separately
mentioned. Stow had died in great poverty, and
indeed had been for many years a licensed beggar or
bedesman; but in his youth he had been enabled by
Parker's protection to make a good collection out of
the spoils of the Abbeys; during the Elizabethan
persecution he was nearly convicted of treason for
being in possession of remnants of Popery, and found
it very hard to convince the stern inquisitor that he
was only a harmless antiquary. Sir Symonds D'Ewes
had endeavoured by his will, which he modelled upon
that of De Thou, to preserve undispersed through the
ages to come the 'precious library' bequeathed in a
touching phrase 'to Adrian D'Ewes, my young son,
yet lying in the cradle.' Notwithstanding all his
bonds and penalties the event which he dreaded came
to pass. Harley had advised Queen Anne to buy a
collection that included so many precious documents
and records: the Queen, wishing perhaps to rebuff
her minister, said that it was indeed no merit in her
to prefer arts to arms, 'but while the blood and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
honour of the nation was at stake in her wars she
could not, till she had secured her living subjects an
honourable peace, bestow their money upon dead
letters'; and so, we are told, 'the Earl stretched his
own purse, and gave &pound;6000 for the library.' Peter
Le Neve spent his life in gathering important papers
about coat-armour and pedigrees. He had intended
them for the use of his fellow Kings-at-Arms; but it
was said that he had some pique against the Heralds'
College, and so 'cut them off with a volume.' The
rest went to the auction-room: 'The Earl of Oxford,'
said Oldys, 'will have a sweep at it'; and we know
that the cast was successful. As for John Bagford,
the scourge of the book-world, we have little to say
in his defence. In his audacious design of compiling
a history of printing he mangled and mutilated about
25,000 volumes, tearing out the title pages and colophons
and shaving the margins even of such priceless
jewels of bibliography as the Bible of Gutenberg and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'those'">those</ins> of 'Polyglott' Cardinal Xim&egrave;nes. He cannot
avoid conviction as a literary monster; yet his contemporaries
regarded him as a miracle of erudition,
and Mr. Pollard has lately put in a kindly plea in
mitigation. We are reminded that Bagford made no
money by his crimes, that he took walking-tours
through Holland and Germany in search of bargains,
and that he made 'a priceless collection of ballads.'
It might be said also for a further plea that what one
age regards as sport another condemns as butchery.
The Ferrar family at Little Gidding were the inven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>tors
of 'pasting-printing,' as they called their barbarous
mode of embellishment; and Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span> himself,
in Laud's presence, called their largest scrap-book
'the Emperor of all books,' and 'the incomparablest
book this will be, as ever eye beheld.' The huge
volume made up for Prince Charles out of pictures
and scraps of text was joyfully pronounced to be 'the
gallantest greatest book in the world.' The practice
of 'grangerising,' or stuffing out an author with prints
and pages from other works, was even praised by
Dibdin as 'useful and entertaining,' though in our
own time it is rightly condemned as a malpractice.</p>

<p>Next to Harley's library in importance was that of
John Moore, Bishop of Ely, of which Burnet said that
it was a treasure beyond what one would think the
life and labour of a man could compass. Oldys has
described it in his notes upon London libraries,
which it is fair to remember were based on Bagford's
labours, as regards the earlier entries. 'The Bishop,'
he says, 'had a prodigious collection of books, written
as well as printed on vellum, some very ancient,
others finely illuminated. He had a Capgrave's
Chronicle, books of the first printing at Maintz and
other places abroad, as also at Oxford, St. Alban's,
Westminster, etc.' There was some talk of uniting
it with Harley's collection; but in 1715 it was bought
by George <span class="smcap">i.</span> for 6000 guineas, and was presented to
the Public Library at Cambridge.</p>

<p>The University had possessed a library from very
early times. It owed much to the liberality of several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
successive Bishops of Durham. Theodore Beza and
Lord Bacon were afterwards among its most distinguished
benefactors. Bishop Hacket made a donation
of nearly fifteen hundred volumes: and in 1647 a
large collection of Eastern <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, brought home from
Italy by George Thomason, was added by an ordinance
of the Commonwealth. But, until the royal gift
of the Bishop of Ely's books, the University received
no such extraordinary favour of fortune as came to
the sister institution through the splendid beneficence
of Bodley.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>BODLEY&mdash;DIGBY&mdash;LAUD&mdash;SELDEN&mdash;ASHMOLE.</h3>


<p>The University of Oxford still offers public thanks
for Bodley's generosity upon his calendar-day. The
ancient library of Duke Humphrey and his pious
predecessors had, as we have seen, been plundered
and devastated. But Sir Thomas Bodley, when
retiring from office in 1597, conceived the idea of
restoring it to prosperity again; 'and in a few years
so richly endowed it with books, revenues, and
buildings, that it became one of the most famous in
the world.' Bodley has left us his own account of
the matter:&mdash;'I concluded at the last to set up my
staff at the library-door in Oxon. I found myself
furnished with such four kinds of aids as, unless I had
them all, I had no hope of success. For without
some kind of knowledge, without some purse-ability
to go through with the charge, without good store of
friends to further the design, and without special
good leisure to follow such a work, it could not but
have proved a vain attempt.' When M&eacute;ric Casaubon
visited Oxford a few years afterwards he found the
hall filled with books. 'Do not imagine,' he wrote,
'that there are as many <span class="smcap">mss.</span> here as in the royal
library at Paris. There are a good many in England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
though nothing to what our King possesses; but the
number of printed books is wonderful, and increasing
every year. During my visit to Oxford I passed
whole days in this place. The books cannot be taken
away, but it is open to scholars for seven or eight
hours a day, and one may always see a number of
them revelling at their banquet, which gave me no
small pleasure.' Bodley was not one of those who
like libraries to be open to all comers. 'A grant of
such scope,' said his statute, 'would but minister an
occasion of pestering all the room with their gazing;
and the babbling and trampling up and down may
disturb out of measure the endeavours of those that
are studious. Admission, from the first, was granted
only to graduates, and every one on his entrance had
to take the oath against 'razing, defacing, cutting,
noting, slurring, and mangling the books.'</p>

<p>Sir Thomas was ably seconded by 'good Mr.
James,' his first librarian, and by the bookseller John
Bill, who collected for him at Frankfort and Lyons
and other likely places on the Continent. The most
minute rules were laid down for the protection of the
books against embezzlement. The volumes were
chained to the desks, and readers were entreated to
fasten the clasps and strings, to untangle the chains,
and to leave the books as they found them. Bodley
was always enquiring about the store of chains and
wires. 'I pray you write to John Smith,' he said to
James, 'that I may be furnished against Easter with
a thousand chains'; he hopes to bring enough for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that number, 'if God send my books safe out of Italy.'
About the time of the King's visit he writes that he
has sent a case of wires and clips by the carrier,
'which I make no doubt but you may in good time
get fastened to your books.' His carefulness is shown
by his directions for cleaning the room: 'I do desire
that, after the library is well swept and the books
cleansed from dust, you would cause the floor to be
well washed and dried, and after rubbed with a little
rosemary, for a stronger scent I should not like.' He
often writes about his Continental purchases. John
Bill, he says, had been at Venice, Florence, and Rome,
and half a score other Italian cities, 'and hath bought
us many books as he knew I had not, amounting to
the sum of at least &pound;400.' With regard to certain
duplicates he says: 'the fault is mine and John Bill's,
who dealing with multitudes must perforce make
many scapes.' 'Jo. Bill hath gotten everywhere what
the place would afford, for his commission was large,
his leisure very good, and his payment sure at home.'
The agent bought largely at Seville; 'but the people's
usage towards all of our nation is so cruel and
malicious that he was utterly discouraged.'</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/10.jpg"><img src="./images/10_th.jpg" alt="SIR THOMAS BODLEY." title="SIR THOMAS BODLEY." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">SIR THOMAS BODLEY.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Bodley would accept a very small
contribution or the gift of a single volume of any
respectable sort. But he would have no 'riff-raff,' as
he told Dr. James, and would certainly have scorned
the almanacs and play-books acquired after his death
under a bequest from the melancholy Burton, and
the ships' logs and 'pickings of chandlers' and grocers'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
papers' which were received long afterwards as part
of Dr. Rawlinson's great donation. He was always
grateful for a well-meant present. He writes to his
librarian: 'Mr. Schoolmaster of Winton's gift of
Melanchthon and Huss I do greatly esteem, and will
thank him, if you will, by letter.' Some of the earliest
gifts were of a splendid kind. Lord Essex sent three
hundred folios, including a fine Bud&aelig;us from the
library of Jerome Osorio, captured at Faro in Portugal
when the fleet was returning from Cadiz. Bodley
himself gave a magnificent <i>Romance of Alexander</i>
that had belonged in 1466 to Richard Woodville,
Lord Rivers. The librarian contributed about a
hundred volumes, including early <span class="smcap">mss.</span> procured from
Balliol and Merton by his persuasion. Merton
College, for its own part, sent nearly two-score
volumes of 'singular good books in folio.' Sir Henry
Savile gave the 'Gospels' in Russian and the Greek
'Commentaries on St. Augustine,' and William
Camden out of his poverty brought a few manuscripts
and ancient books. Lawrence Bodley, the founder's
brother, came with thirty-seven 'very fair and new-bought
works in folio, and Lord Lumley with forty
volumes reserved out of the library sold to the Prince.
Lord Montacute contributed the works of the Fathers,
'in sixty-six costly great volumes, all bought of set
purpose and fairly bound with his arms,' Mr. Gent a
number of medical treatises, Sir John Fortescue five
good Greek <span class="smcap">mss.</span> and forty other books. We only
mention a few of the choicer specimens or note the re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>appearance
of old friends described in earlier chapters.
In 1602 there arrived from Exeter Bishop Leofric's
vellum service-book, with several others that had
lodged in its company since the days of Edward the
Confessor. Next year came one of the exquisite
'Gospels' which Pope Gregory, as men said, had given
to the missionary Augustine; the other had been included
in Parker's gift to Corpus Christi. Sir Henry
Wotton contributed a valuable Koran, to which in
later years he added Tycho Brah&eacute;s 'Astronomy'
with the author's <span class="smcap">ms.</span> notes. Thomas Allen gave
a relic of St. Dunstan, containing the Saint's portrait
drawn by himself, and one of Grost&ecirc;te's books that
had been given by the Friars to Dr. Gascoigne.
Mr. Allen gave in all twelve rare <span class="smcap">mss.</span> besides printed
books, 'with a purpose to do more'; and Bodley
commends him as a most careful provoker and
solicitor of benefactions. He was the mathematician,
or rather the cabalistical astrologer, who taught Sir
Kenelm Digby, introducing that romantic giant to
the art of ruling the stars, and how to melt and puff
'until the green dragon becomes the golden goose,'
and all the other <i>arcana</i> of alchemy.</p>

<p>Digby was a good friend to the Bodleian. When
quite a youth he cut down fifty great oaks to purchase
a building-site near Exeter College. The laying of
the foundation-stone in 1634 was amusingly described
by Wood. The Heads of Houses were all assembled,
and the University musicians 'had sounded a lesson
on their wind-music,' standing on the leads at the west<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
end of the library; but while the Vice-Chancellor was
placing a piece of gold on the first stone, the earth
fell in, and the scaffold broke, 'so that all those who
were thereon, the Proctors, Principals of Halls, etc.,
fell down all together one upon another, among whom
the under-butler of Exeter College had his shoulder
broken or put out of joint, and a scholar's arm bruised.'
It was at this time that Digby made a generous gift
of books, all tall copies in good bindings with his
initials on the panels at the back. Among them were
early works on science by Grost&ecirc;te and Roger Bacon,
besides histories and chronicles. Many of these
books had belonged to Thomas Allen, who gave them
to Digby as a token of regard. Sir Kenelm wrote
about them to Sir Robert Cotton, who was to thank
Allen for his kindness: 'in my hands they will not be
with less honourable memory of him than in any
man's else.' He felt sure that Allen would have
wished them to be freely used: 'all good things are
the better the more they are communicated'; but
the University was to be the absolute mistress, 'to
dispose of them as she pleaseth.' Mr. Macray quotes
another passage about two trunks of Arabic <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
Digby had given them to Laud for St. John's College
or the Bodleian, as he might prefer, but nothing had
been heard about their arrival. He promised more
books from his own library, which had been taken
over to France after the Civil War broke out. The
books, however, remained abroad, and were confiscated
on Digby's death as being the chattels of an alien<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
resident; but either by favour or purchase they soon
became the property of the Earl of Bristol, and were
afterwards sold by auction in London. Two volumes
were purchased for the Bodleian in 1825 which must
be regarded with the deepest interest. The 'Bacon'
and 'Proclus' had belonged to the Oxford Friars, to
Gascoigne, to the astrologer secluded in Gloucester
Hall. Digby had written a note in each that it was
the book of the University Library, as witnessed by
his initials; but it had taken them many generations
to make the last stage of their journey from his book-shelf
to their acknowledged home at Oxford.</p>

<p>It was chiefly through the generosity of Laud that
the Bodleian obtained its wealth of Oriental learning.
But it was not only in the East that the Archbishop
devoted himself to book-collecting. Like Dr. Dee, he
saw the value of Ireland as a hunting-ground, and
employed his emissaries to procure painted service-books,
the records of native princes, and the archives of
the Anglo-Norman nobility. Among his most precious
acquisitions was an Irish <span class="smcap">ms.</span> containing the <i>Psalter of
Cashel</i>, Cormac's still unpublished <i>Glossary</i>, and some
of the poems ascribed to St. Patrick and St. Columba.
On the Continent the armies of Gustavus Adolphus
were ravaging the cities of Germany; and Laud's
agents were always at hand to rescue the fair books
and vellums from the Swedish pikemen. In this way
he obtained the printed Missal of 1481 and a number
of Latin <span class="smcap">mss.</span> from the College of W&uuml;rzburg, and
other valuable books from monasteries near Mainz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and Eberbach in the Duchy of Baden. It appears by
Mr. Macray's Annals that his gifts to the University
between 1635 and 1640 amounted to about thirteen
hundred volumes, in more than twenty languages.
To our minds the most attractive will always be the
very copy of the 'Acts' perused by the Venerable
Bede, and the 'Anglo-Saxon Chronicle' compiled in
the Abbey of Peterborough. The men of Laud's age
would perhaps have attached greater importance to
the Eastern <span class="smcap">mss.</span> acquired by the Archbishop through
Robert Huntingdon, the consul at Aleppo, or the
Greek library of Francesco Barocci, which he persuaded
William Earl of Pembroke to present to the University.
In describing the Persian <span class="smcap">mss.</span> of his last gift, Laud
specially mentioned one as containing a history of the
world from the Creation to the end of the Saracen
Empire, and as being of a very great value. He shows
the greatest anxiety for the safety of the volumes:
'I would to God the place for them were ready, that
they might be set up safe, and chained as the other
books are.' He gave many books to St. John's
College; and he retained a large collection in his
Palace at Lambeth, which was bestowed on Hugh
Peters after his death; it is satisfactory, however, to
remember that 'the study of books' was recovered at
the Restoration, and that Mr. Ashmole was appointed
to examine the accounts of the fanatic.</p>

<p>Laud was not the first to seek for the treasures of
the East. Before his gifts began Sir Thomas Roe,
who sat for Oxford with Selden, had presented to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Bodleian a number of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> acquired during his embassy
to Constantinople. Joseph Scaliger, the restorer
of Arabic learning in the West, had been especially
interested in Samaritan literature, and had corresponded
about a copy of the Pentateuch with one
Rabbi Eleazar, 'who dwelt in Sichem'; and, though
the papers fell into the hands of robbers, they were
afterwards delivered to Peiresc. The traveller
Minutius had returned with Coptic service-books, and
Peiresc, captivated with a new branch of learning,
established an agency for Eastern books at Smyrna.
The Capucin Gilles de Loche averred that he had
seen 8000 volumes in a monastery of the Nitrian
Desert,'many of which seemed to be of the age of St.
Anthony': he had pushed into Abyssinia and had heard
the 'uncouth chaunts and clashing cymbals,' as Mr.
Curzon heard them in a later age; and he had even
cast his eyes on the <i>Book of Enoch</i> with pallid figures
and a shining black text; and Peiresc was so inflamed
with a desire to buy it at any price that in the end he
acquired it. The books seen by the Capucin in the
Convent of the Syrians, stored 'in the vault beyond
the oil-cellar,'have become our national property; and
if there are not many of the age of St. Anthony we
have at least the volume, completed by the help of a
monk's note of the eleventh century, and originally
written in the year 411 'at Ur of the Chaldees by the
hand of a man named Jacob.'</p>

<p>Much less attention seems to have been paid to the
collection of Hebrew books than to those in Coptic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and Arabic. Selden, it is true, gave to the University
Library 'such of his Talmudical and Rabbinical books
as were not already to be found there,' and purchases
were made at the Crevenna sale in Amsterdam and
at a sale during the present century of the <span class="smcap">mss.</span> of
Matheo Canonici at Venice. The chief source from
which the Bodleian was supplied was the collection
formed before 1735 by David Oppenheimer, the Chief
Rabbi at Prague. In the British Museum are the
Hebrew books presented by Solomon da Costa in
1759. The donor's letter contained a few interesting
details. There were three Biblical <span class="smcap">mss.</span> and a hundred
and eighty printed books, all in very old editions:
'They were bound by order of King Charles <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, and
marked with his cypher, and were purchased by me
in the days of my youth, and the particulars are they
not written in the book that is found therewith?'
They had been collected under the Commonwealth,
and had afterwards been sent to the binder by King
Charles; but as the bill was never paid they lay
in the shop until the reign of George <span class="smcap">i.</span>, when they
were sold to pay expenses, and so came into the
possession of the excellent Solomon da Costa.</p>

<p>The best antiquarian collections were those given
to Oxford by Dr. Rawlinson in the last century,
by Richard Gough in 1809, and by Mr. Douce in
1834. Mr. Macray has enumerated nearly thirty
libraries which Richard Rawlinson had laid under
contribution, and his list includes such headings as the
Miscellaneous Papers of Samuel Pepys, the Thurloe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
State Papers, the remains of Thomas Hearne, and
documents belonging to Gale and Michael Maittaire,
Sir Joseph Jekyll, and Walter Clavell of the Temple.
He cites a letter written by Rawlinson in 1741, as
showing the curious accidents by which some of these
documents were preserved: 'My agent last week
met with some papers of Archbishop Wake at a
chandler's shop: this is unpardonable in his executors,
as all his <span class="smcap">mss.</span> were left to Christ Church; but <i>qu&aelig;re</i>
whether these did not fall into some servant's hands,
who was ordered to burn them, and Mr. Martin
Folkes ought to have seen that done.'</p>

<p>Mr. Gough's collection related chiefly to English
topography, Anglo-Saxon and Northern literature,
and printed service-books; it is stated to contain
more than 3700 volumes, all given by a generous
bequest to form 'an Antiquary's Closet.' Mr. Douce's
large library contained a number of Missals and
<i>Livres d'Heures</i>. Some of these are described as
'priceless gems rivalled only by the Bedford
Missal,' especially one prayer-book illuminated for
Leonora, Duchess of Urbino, another that belonged
to Marie de M&eacute;dici, and 'a Psalter on purple
vellum, probably of the ninth century, which came
from the old Royal Library of France.' Among the
most important of the earlier benefactions was the
gift of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the the'">the</ins> Dodsworth Papers by Thomas Lord
Fairfax. The archives of the Northern monasteries
had been kept for a time in eight chests in St. Mary's
Tower at York. Roger Dodsworth, Sir William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Dugdale's colleague in the preparation of the
Monasticon, made copies of many of these documents;
and when the tower was blown up in the
siege of 1644 he was one of the zealous antiquarians
who saved the mouldering fragments on the breach.
His whole store of arch&aelig;ological records became the
property of Fairfax at his death. They are of great
historical importance, but at one time they were
strangely neglected. Wood says that all the papers
were nearly spoiled in a damp season, when he
obtained leave to dry them on the leads near the
schools; but though it cost him a month's labour he
undertook it with pleasure 'out of respect to the
memory of Mr. Dodsworth.'</p>

<p>The Ashmolean books were some years ago transferred
to the Bodleian, but for several generations
there was a strange assortment of antiquarian libraries
gathered together in the Museum which Ashmole
developed out of Madam Tradescant's 'closet of
curiosities.' Here were the books of the shiftless
John Aubrey, described by Wood as 'sometimes
little better than crazed': and here, according to
Wood's dying wish, lay his own books, 'and papers
and notes about two bushels full,' side by side with
Dugdale's manuscripts. Dibdin quotes several
extracts from Elias Ashmole's diary, to show the
old book-hunter's prowess in the chase. He buys on
one day Mr. Milbourn's books, and on the next all
that Mr. Hawkins left; he sees Mrs. Backhouse of
London about the purchase of her late husband's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
library. In 1667 he writes: 'I bought Mr. John
Booker's study of books, and gave &pound;140.' Being
somewhat of an alchemist, he was glad to become
the owner of Lilly's volumes on magic, and most of
Dr. Dee's collection came into his hands through the
kindness of his friend Mr. Wale. When Ashmole
brought out his book upon the Order of the Garter he
became the associate of the nobility; and we will
leave him feasting at his house in South Lambeth,
clad in a velvet gown, and wearing his great chain
'of philagreen links in great knobs,' with ninety loops
of gold.</p>

<p>In noticing the lawyers who have been eminent
for their devotion to books we might go back to very
early times. We ought at least to mention Sergeant
William Fletewode, Recorder of London in the
reign of Elizabeth, who bought a library out of
Missenden Abbey, consisting mainly of the romances
of chivalry; it was sold with its later additions in
1774 under the title of <i>Bibliotheca Monastico-Fletewodiana</i>.
The Lord Chancellor Ellesmere in
the same reign formed a collection of old English
poetry, which became the foundation of a celebrated
library belonging to the Dukes of Bridgewater and
afterwards to the Marquis of Stafford. Sir Julius
C&aelig;sar, who was Master of the Rolls under James <span class="smcap">i.</span>,
was 'often reflected upon' for his want of legal
knowledge; but he collected a quantity of good <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
which passed into the library of Mr. Carteret-Webb,
after a narrow escape of being sold for &pound;10 to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
cheesemonger. They are now in the British Museum
together with a box of exquisite miniature classics,
with which he used to solace himself on a journey.
Arthur, Earl of Anglesea, was another distinguished
lawyer, who was famous for having acquired the
finest specimens of books in 'all faculties, arts, and
languages.'</p>

<p>The great bulk of Selden's books were given by
his executors to the Bodleian; but several chests of
monastic manuscripts were sent to the Inner Temple,
and perished in a fire. He passed his whole life as a
scholar; and yet, it is said, he deplored the loss of
his time, and wished that he had neglected what the
world calls learning, and had rather 'executed the
office of a justice of the peace.' Sir Matthew Hale
should be remembered for his gift of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> to Lincoln's
Inn. He made it a condition that they should never
be printed; and the language of his will shows a
certain dread of dealing lightly with the secrets of
tenure and prerogative. 'My desire is that they be
kept safe and all together in remembrance of me.
They were fit to be bound in leather, and chained
and kept in archives: they are a treasure not fit for
every man's view, nor is every man capable of making
use of them.'</p>

<p>We shall close our account of the century with a
few words about Dr. Bernard, a stiff, hard, and
straightforward reader, whose library of medicine
and general literature was sold by auction in 1698.
'Being a person who collected his books not for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
ostentation or ornament he seemed no more solicitous
about their dress than his own'; and therefore, says
the compiler of his catalogue, 'you'll find that a gilt
back or a large margin was very seldom any inducement
to him to buy. It was sufficient to him that he
had the book.' 'The garniture of a book,' he would
observe,'was apt to recommend it to a great part of
our modern collectors'; he himself was not a mere
nomenclator, and versed only in title-pages, 'but had
made that just and laudable use of his books which
would become all those that set up for collectors.' He
was the possessor of thirteen fine Caxtons, which
fetched altogether less than two guineas at his sale;
the biddings seem to have been by the penny; and
Mr. Clarke in his <i>Repertorium Bibliographicum</i> observed
that the penny at that time seems to have
been more than the equivalent of our pound sterling
in the purchase of black-letter rarities.</p>

<h3>GROLIER AND HIS SUCCESSORS.</h3>


<p>Jean Grolier, the prince of book-collectors, was
born at Lyons in 1479. His family had come
originally from Verona, but had long been naturalised
in France. Several of his relations held civic offices;
&Eacute;tienne Grolier, his father, was in charge of the
taxes in the district of Lyons, and was appointed
treasurer of the Milanese territories at that time in
the occupation of the French. Jean Grolier succeeded
his father in both these employments. He
was treasurer of Milan in 1510, when Pope Julius
formed the league against the French, which was
crushed at the Battle of Ravenna; and for nearly
twenty years afterwards Grolier took a principal part
in administering the affairs of the province. Young,
rich, and powerful, a lover of the arts and a bountiful
patron of learning, he became an object of almost
superstitious respect to the authors and booksellers
of Italy. He was eager to do all in his power
towards improving the machinery and diffusing
the products of science. He loved his books not
only for what they taught but also as specimens of
typography and artistic decoration. To own one or
two examples from his library is to take high rank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in the army of bookmen. The amateur of bindings
need learn little more when he comprehends the
stages of Grolier's literary passion, its fervent and
florid beginnings, the majesty of its progress, and its
austere simplicities in old age.</p>

<p>Grolier was the personal friend of Gryphius, the
printer of Lyons, and of all the members of the
House of Aldus at Venice. Erasmus, who was
revered by Grolier as his god-father in matters of
learning, once paid a compliment to the treasurer,
which was not far from the truth. 'You owe nothing
to books,' he wrote, 'but they owe a good deal to
you, because it is by your help that they will go
down to posterity.' The nature of Grolier's relations
with the Venetian publishers appears in his letters to
Francis of Asola about the printing of a work by
Bud&aelig;us. He writes from Milan in the year 1519:
'I am thinking every day about sending you the
"Bud&aelig;us" for publication in your most elegant style.
You must add to your former favours by being very
diligent in bringing out my friend's book, of which I
now send you the manuscript revised and corrected
by the author. You must take the greatest care,
dear Francis, to present it to the public in an accurate
shape, and this indeed I must beg and implore. I
want beauty and refinement besides; but this we
shall get from your choice paper, unworn type, and
breadth of margin. In a word, I want to have it in
the same style as your "Politian." If all this extra
luxury should put you to loss, I will make it good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I am most anxious that the manuscript should be
followed exactly, without any change or addition;
and so, my dear Francis, fare you well.' The book
appeared with a dedication to Grolier himself, in
which Francis of Asola recounts the many favours
received by the elder Aldus in his lifetime, by himself,
and by his father Andreas. The presentation
copy was magnificently printed on vellum, with
initials in gold and colours. Grolier inscribed it
with his name and device, so that it became easy to
verify its subsequent history. It appeared among
the books of the Prince de Soubise, and belonged
afterwards to the Count Macarthy, and in 1815 was
bought by Mr. Payne and transferred to the Althorp
Library.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/11.jpg"><img src="./images/11_th.jpg" alt="BINDING EXECUTED FOR GROLIER." title="BINDING EXECUTED FOR GROLIER." /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">BINDING EXECUTED FOR GROLIER.</p>

<p>Grolier's books were generally stamped with the
words '<i>et Amicorum</i>' immediately after his name, to
indicate as we suppose that they were the common
property of himself and his friends, although it has
been suggested that he was referring to his possession
of duplicates. Another of his marks was the use of
some pious phrase, such as a wish that his portion
might be in 'the land of the living,' which was either
printed on the cover or written on a fly-leaf, if the
volume were the gift of a friend. In the use of these
distinctions he seems to have been preceded by
Thomas Maioli, a book-collector of a family residing
at Asti, of whom very little is known apart from his
ownership of books in magnificent bindings. Grolier
may have borrowed the phrase about his friends from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a celebrated Flemish collector called Marcus Laurinus,
or Mark Lauwrin of Watervliet, who was in constant
correspondence with the Treasurer about their cabinets
of medals and coins. Rabelais had a few valuable
books, which he stamped with a similar design in
Greek, and the Latin form occurs in many other
libraries. We are inclined to refer the origin of the
practice to a letter written by Philelpho in 1427, in
which he tells his correspondent of the Greek proverb
that all things are common among friends.</p>

<p>Grolier's love of learning is shown by his own
letters, and by the statements contained in the books
that were so constantly dedicated to his name. To
Beatus Rhenanus he wrote, with reference to an
approaching visit: 'Oh, what a festal day, to be
marked (as they say) with a pure white stone, when
I am able to pay my humble duty to my own
Rhenanus; and you see how great are my demands
when you are entered as mine in my accounts.' As
controller of the Milanese district he became the
object of much adulation, for which his flatterers
had to atone when the French occupation came to
an end. The dedication of a certain dialogue
affords an instance in point. Stefano Negri sent his
book to Grolier in a splendid shape. The presentation
copy on vellum may be seen at the British
Museum among the treasures of the Grenville Library.
The writer represents himself in the preface as going
about in search of a patron. He sees Mercury
descending from the clouds with a message from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Minerva. 'There is one man whom the Goddess
holds dear, struggling like Ulysses through the flood
of this stormy life: he is known as Grolier to the
world.' Nay, what need have you, says the author,
to sing the praises of that famous man? 'You must
confess, even if you like it not, that he is most noble
in his country and family, most wealthy in fortune,
and most fair and beautiful in his bodily gifts.'</p>

<p>As patron of all the arts the treasurer became the
friend of Francino Gafori, the leader of the new school
of music that was flourishing at Milan. Gafori seems
to have been often in Grolier's company. He dedicated
to the treasurer his work on the harmony of
musical instruments, as well as the <i>Apologia</i> in which
he afterwards convicted the Bologna school of its
errors. 'My work,' he says in his later book, 'is
sound enough if soundly understood'; and he tells
his rival that, though he may writhe with rage, the
harmony of Gafori and the fame of Jean Grolier will
live for ever. The introduction to his work upon
harmony contains a few interesting details about
Grolier's way of living at Milan. Gafori addresses
his book in a dialogue, and vows that it shall never
come home again if Grolier refuses to be the patron.
A poetical friend adds a piece in which the Muses
appear without their proper emblems, and even
Apollo is bereft of his lyre. Gafori, they say, has
taken away their harmonies and will not give them
back. They are advised to make their way to the
concert at Grolier's house, where the friend of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Muses sits among the learned doctors. An illustration
shows Gafori sitting at his organ and the
musicians with their wind-instruments at the end of
the lofty hall. Gafori himself, in another preface,
declares that his musical offspring can hardly be
kept at home; they used to be too shy to go out,
though all the musicians were awaiting them; now
that they have Grolier's patronage they are all as
bold as brass, and ready to rush through any danger
to salute their generous friend. The history of the
copy presented to Grolier is not without interest.
After the great musician's death the treasurer gave
it to Albisse, one of the King's secretaries: Albisse
in 1546 gave it to Rasse de Neux, a surgeon at Paris,
who was devoted to curious books; in 1674 it entered
the library of St. Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, and was nearly
destroyed more than a century afterwards in a great
fire. During the Revolution it was added to the
collection at the Convent des C&eacute;lestins, and was afterwards
deposited in the Biblioth&egrave;que de l'Arsenal,
where we suppose that it still remains.</p>

<p>Grolier was fond of giving books to his friends. A
commentary on the Psalms with his name and device,
now in the National Library at Paris, bears an
inscription showing that he had given it to a monk
named Jacques Guyard. He presented a fine copy
of Marcus Aurelius to his friend Eurialo Silvestri;
and there are volumes bearing his name in conjunction
with those of Maioli and Laurinus which indicate
similar gifts. He is known to have presented several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
volumes to the President de Thou as a mark of
gratitude for assistance during his later troubles. It
is somewhat singular that Jacques-Auguste de Thou
never succeeded in getting possession of these books,
though they had always been kept in his father's
library; and they were not, indeed, replaced in the
'Bibliotheca Thuana' until it had become the property
of the Cardinal de Rohan. It is interesting to learn
that a volume of Cicero was given by Grolier to the
artistic printer, Geoffroy Tory of Bourges, who
designed the lettering of his mottoes: they were of
an antique or 'Roman' shape, and were in two sizes,
and proportioned, as we are told, 'in the same ratio
to each other as the body and face of a man.'
Geoffroy Tory mentioned them in a letter of the year
1523. 'It was on the morrow of the Epiphany,' says
the light-hearted artist, 'that after my slumbers were
over, and in consciousness of a joyous repast, I lay
day-dreaming in bed, and twisting the wheels of my
memory round: I thought of a thousand little fancies
both grave and gay, and then there came before my
mind those antique letters that I used to make for
my lord, Master Jean Grolier, the King's councillor,
and a friend of the <i>Belles Lettres</i> and of all men of
learning, by whom he is loved and esteemed on both
sides of the Alps.'</p>

<p>Another testimony comes from Dr. Sambucus, who
knew Grolier well when he was living in Paris, and
used to be fond of inspecting his cabinet of coins.
In the last year of Grolier's life he received a book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
on the subject with a dedication to himself by the
worthy Doctor. Grolier was reminded in the preface
of their long talks on antiquarian subjects, and of the
kindness which Sambucus had received from the
treasurer and the treasurer's father at Milan. 'During
the last three years,' says Sambucus, 'I have been
enriching my library, and I have added some very
scarce coins to the cabinet that you used to admire.'
He adds a few complaints about dealers and the
tricks of the trade, which we need not repeat. 'And
now farewell!' he ends, 'noble ornament of a noble
race, by whose mouth nothing has ever been uttered
that came not from the heart!'</p>

<p>Some account of Grolier's career is to be found in
De Thou's great history. He praised the 'incredible
love of learning' that had earned for a mere youth
the intimate friendship of Bud&aelig;us. He showed with
what administrative ability the Milanese territories
were governed, and with what dignity Grolier filled
the high office of Treasurer at home.</p>

<p>Grolier, he says, built a magnificent mansion in the
Rue de Bussy, which was known as the H&ocirc;tel de
Lyon; in one of its halls he arranged the multitude
of books 'so carefully, and with such a fine effect, that
the library might have been compared to that which
Pollio established in Rome'; and so great was the
supply that, notwithstanding his many gifts to friends
and various misfortunes which befell his collection,
every important library in France was able after his
death to show some of his grand bindings as its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
principal ornament. Grolier's old age was disturbed
by imputations against his official conduct, and it
seemed at one time as if his fortune were in considerable
danger. 'He was so confident in his innocence,'
said the historian,'that he would not seek help from
his friends; but he might have fallen at last, if he
had not been protected by my father the President,
who always used his influence to help the weak
against the strong and the scholar against the ignorance
of the vulgar.' The old Treasurer kept his
serene course of life until he reached his eighty-sixth
year: he died at his H&ocirc;tel de Lyon, surrounded by
his books, and was buried near the high altar in the
Church of St. Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s.</p>

<p>Upon Grolier's death his property was divided
among his daughters' families. Some of the books
were certainly sold; but the greater part of the
library became the property of M&eacute;ric de Vic, the old
Treasurer's son-in-law. M&eacute;ric was keeper of the
seals to Louis <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> His son Dominique became
Archbishop of Auch. They were both fond of books,
and took great care of Grolier's three thousand exquisite
volumes, of which they were successively the
owners. They lived in a large house in the Rue St.
Martin, which had been built by Bud&aelig;us, and here
the books were kept until the great dispersion in the
year 1676. 'They looked,' said Bonaventure d'Argonne, 'as
if the Muses had taken the outsides into
their charge, as well as the contents, they were
adorned with such art and <i>esprit</i>, and looked so gay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with a delicate gilding quite unknown to the book-binders
of our time.' The same visitor described the
sale of 1676. All Paris was to be seen at the H&ocirc;tel
de Vic. 'Such a glorious collection ought all to
have been kept together; but, as it was, everybody
got some share of the spoil.' He bought some of
the best specimens himself; and as he was only a
poor monk of the Chartreuse the prices can hardly
have run high. M. Le Roux de Lincy has traced
the fate of the volumes dispersed at the sale. We
hear, he says, of examples belonging to De Mesmes
and Bigot, to Colbert and Lamoignon, Captain du
Fay, the Count d'Hoym, and the Prince de Soubise.
Some of the finest were purchased by Baron Hohendorf
and were transferred about the year 1720 to the
Imperial Library at Vienna. Yet they never rose to
any high price until the Soubise sale towards the end
of the last century, when the weight of the English
competition for books began to be felt upon the
Continent.</p>

<p>M. de Lincy has traced the adventures of more
than three hundred volumes, once in Grolier's ownership,
but now for the most part in public libraries.
The earlier possessors are classified according to the
dates of their purchases. Of those who obtained
specimens soon after the old Treasurer's death we may
notice especially Paul P&eacute;tau the antiquarian, De Thou
the historian, and Pithou the statesman and jurist.
Perhaps we should add Jean Ballesdens, a collector
of fine books and <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, whose library at his death in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
1677 contained nine of Grolier's books, and Pierre
S&eacute;guier, to whom Ballesdens acted as secretary; and
as S&eacute;guier was the personal friend of Grolier, he may
have been the original recipient of some of the
volumes in question.</p>

<p>Pierre S&eacute;guier founded a library which became one
of the sights of Paris. His grandson, Charles S&eacute;guier,
the faithful follower of Richelieu, was celebrated for
his devotion to books. He used to laugh at his own
bibliomania. 'If you want to corrupt me' he would
say, 'you can always do it by giving me a book.'
His house in the Rue Bouloi served as headquarters
for the French Academy before it gained a footing
in the Louvre; and on Queen Christina's visit in 1646
one of her first literary excitements was to visit
Chancellor S&eacute;guier's <i>salon</i>. The decorations were
considered worthy of being engraved and published
by Dorigny. The gallery stood between two large
gardens. The ceilings were encrusted with mosaics
on a gold ground with allegorical designs by Vouet.
The upper story contained about 12,000 books, and
as many more were ranged in the adjoining rooms,
one large hall being devoted to diplomatic papers,
Greek books from Mount Athos, and Oriental <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
According to a description published in 1684 a large
collection of porcelain was arranged on the walls
above the book-cases and in cases set cross-wise on
the floor: 'the china covered the whole cornice, with
the prettiest effect in the world.' We are reminded
of the lady's book-room which Addison described as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
something between a grotto and a library. Her books
were arranged in a beautiful order; the quartos were
fenced off by a pile of bottles that rose in a delightful
pyramid; the octavos were bounded by tea-dishes of
all shapes and sizes; 'and at the end of the folios
were great jars of china placed one above the other
in a very noble piece of architecture.'</p>

<p>Among the purchasers at the later sale we may
notice the witty Esprit Fl&eacute;chier, who bought several
of the lighter Latin poets, being a fashionable versifier
himself and a dilettante in matters of binding and
typography. In his account of the High Commission
in Auvergne, appointed to examine into charges of
feudal tyranny, the Abb&eacute; tells us how his reputation
as a bibliophile was spread by a certain P&egrave;re Raphael
at all the watering-places, and how two learned ladies
came to inspect his books and carried off his favourite
Ovid. His library was removed to London and
sold in the year 1725; and the occasion was of some
importance as marking the beginning of the English
demand for specimens from Grolier's library.</p>

<p>Archbishop Le Tellier bought fifteen good examples,
which he bequeathed in 1709, with all his
other books, to the Abbey of St. Genevi&egrave;ve. His
whole collection included about 50,000 volumes,
mostly dealing with history and the writings of the
Fathers. 'I have loved books from my boyhood,'
he said, 'and the taste has grown with age.' He
bought most of his collection during his travels in
Italy, in England, and in Holland; but perhaps the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
best part of his store came from his tutor Antoine
Faure, who left a thousand volumes to the Archbishop,
to be selected at the legatee's discretion.</p>

<p>The most valuable portion of Grolier's library was
bought by his friend Henri de Mesmes. This included
the long series of presentation copies, printed
on vellum, and magnificently bound. De Mesmes
was a collector with a love of curiosities of all kinds.
He seems to have been equally fond of his early
specimens of printing, his Flemish and Italian
illuminations, and the Arabic and Armenian treatises
procured by his agents in the East. His library
became a valuable museum which was praised by all
the writers of that age, except indeed by Fran&ccedil;ois
Pithou, who called De Mesmes a literary grave-digger,
and mourned over the burial of so many good books
in those cold and gloomy sepulchres.</p>

<p>There seems to have been little occasion for this
outburst, since the library was open to all who could
make a good use of it during the life of Henri de
Mesmes and under his son and grandson. Henri de
Mesmes the younger, its owner in the third generation,
was renowned for his zeal in collecting; he is
said to have even procured <span class="smcap">mss.</span> from the Court of the
Great Mogul, dispatched by a French goldsmith at
Delhi, who packed them in red cotton and stuffed
them into the hollow of a bamboo for safer carriage.
One of the finest things in his whole library was the
Psalter which Louis <span class="smcap">ix.</span> had given to Guillaume
de Mesmes: it had come by some means into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the library at Whitehall; but on the execution of
Charles <span class="smcap">i.</span> the French Ambassador had been able
to secure it, and had restored it to the family of the
original donee.</p>

<p>The Norman family of Bigot rivalled the race of
De Mesmes in their ardour for book-collecting. Jean
Bigot in 1649 had a magnificent library of 6000
volumes, partly inherited from his ancestors, and
partly collected out of the monastic libraries at F&eacute;camp
and Mont St. Michel and other places in that
neighbourhood. His son Louis-Emeric took the
library as his share of the inheritance: its improvement
became the occupation of his life; he made
many expeditions after books in foreign countries, but
when he was at home his library was the general
<i>rendez-vous</i> of all who were interested in literature.
The books were left to Robert Bigot upon trusts that
were intended to prevent their dispersion. A sale,
however, took place in 1706, at which the monastic
archives and most of the <span class="smcap">mss.</span> were purchased by the
government.</p>

<p>By some arrangement, of which the history is
unknown, the head of the family of De Mesmes was
persuaded to allow his books to be included in the
Bigot sale. There seems to have been an attempt to
disguise the transaction by tearing off the bindings
and defacing the coats of arms. The strangest thing
about the sale was the fact that no notice was taken
of its containing the finest portion of Grolier's library.
The splendid <i>Aldines</i>, on vellum, fell into the hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of an ignorant notary with a new room to furnish:
and he thought fit to strip off all the bindings, that
had been a marvel of Italian art, and to replace them
with the gaudy coverings that were more suited to
his <i>bourgeois</i> desires.</p>

<p>M. de Lincy remarks that Grolier's books were
strangely neglected through a great part of the
eighteenth century. At the very end of the period,
Count Macarthy had the good taste to include a few
of them in his collection of books upon vellum. Mr.
Cracherode began, in 1793, to buy all the specimens
that came into the market: and the library which he
bequeathed to the British Museum contains no less
than eighteen fine examples. Eight more were
comprised in the magnificent bequest of Mr. Thomas
Grenville's library in 1846. There has been a demand
for these books in England for more than a century
and a half. But when we look at the catalogues of
Gaignat or La Valli&egrave;re they seem to have been
altogether disregarded. When Gaignat died in 1768
his collection was regarded as perfect; it was said
that 'no one in the commonwealth of letters had ever
brought together such a rich and admirable assembly.'
Yet he only had one 'Grolier book,' a magnificent
copy of Paolo Giovio's book on Roman Fishes, which
passed to the Duc de la Valli&egrave;re, and went for a few
<i>livres</i> at his sale. There were only two other
specimens in the Duke's library; and they seem to
have been treated with equal indifference. M. de
Lincy was of opinion that the memory of Grolier was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
almost entirely forgotten, except in his native city of
Lyons. The appearance of his books might be
admired by an antiquary here and there; but the
classics had gone out of fashion for a time, and the
world gave its attention to old poetry, to medi&aelig;val
romance, and even to 'books of <i>faceti&aelig;</i>.'</p>

<p>Grolier's reputation had mainly depended on his
generous patronage of literature. Even the House of
Aldus had rejoiced to be the clients of a new M&aelig;cenas.
The authors of that time were still too weak to go
alone. In the absence of a demand for books it was
essential to gain the favour of a great man who might
open a way to fame and would at least provide a
pension. We have all smiled at the adulations of an
ancient preface and the arrogance which too often
baulked the poor writer's hopes. D'Israeli reminds
us that one of the Popes repaid the translation of a
Greek treatise with a few pence that might just have
paid for the binding, and of Cardinal Este receiving
Ariosto's work with the question&mdash;'Where on earth all
that rubbish had been collected?' This was but a
temporary phase, and literature became free from the
burden as soon as the public had learned to read.
The Houses of Plantin and the Elzevirs required no
help in selling out their cheap editions. A good
dedication was still a feather in the patron's cap.
Queen Christina considered that she was justly
entitled to the patronage of her subjects' works: and
Marshal Rantzau, when writers were scarce in
Denmark, brought out an anonymous work for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
purpose of introducing a preface in which his fame
as a book-collector was glorified. But the patron's
function was gradually restricted; and at last it was
nearly confined to cases where a dedication repaid
assistance given in producing an unsaleable book.</p>

<p>The later renown of Grolier must rest on the fact
that he invented a new taste. It would have been
nothing to buy a few thousand Aldine books, even if
the collection included all the first editions, the papers
of all sizes, the copies with uncut edges, and specimens
of the true misprints. The family of Aldus had a large
library of this kind, which was dispersed at Rome by
its inheritor in the third generation; but it never
attracted much attention, and was generally believed
to have been merged in a collection at Pisa. Grolier
introduced a fashion depending for its success on a
multiplicity of details. He bought books out of large
editions just issuing from the press; but he chose out
the specimen with the best printing, and the finest
paper, if vellum were not forthcoming. The condition
was perfect. Like the Count Macarthy he would
have no dust or worm-holes: he was as microscopic
in his views as the most accurate Parisian bibliophile.
The binding was in the best Italian style: a general
sobriety was relieved by the brilliancy of certain
effects, by the purity of the design, perhaps above all
by the perfection of the materials. The book was an
object of interest, for its contents, or for historical or
personal reasons; but it had also become an <i>objet
d'art</i>, like a gem or a figure in porcelain. Grolier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
preserved his dignity as a bibliophile, and his true
followers have not degenerated into collectors of
<i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i>. It is sufficient to name such men as
M. Renouard, the owner of many of Grolier's treasures,
or M. Firmin-Didot 'the friend of all good books,'
or the collections of Mr. Beckford and Baron Seilli&egrave;re
which have been in our own time dispersed. No
doubt there is a tendency, especially among French
amateurs, to regard books as mere curiosities; and
M. Uzanne has drawn an amusing picture of the
book-hunter as a chrysalis in his library, destined to
find his wings in a flight after mosaic bindings,
autographs, original water-colours, or plates in early
states.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to prevent the 'book-buying
disease' from developing into a general collector's
mania. With the world full of books, we must adopt
some special variety for our admiration. One person
will choose his library companions for their stateliness
and splendid raiment, another for their flavour
of antiquity, or the fine company that they kept in
old times. Montaigne loved his friends on the shelf,
because they always received him kindly and 'blunted
the point of his grief.' He turned the volumes over
in his round tower within any method or design;
'at one while,' he says, 'I meditate, at another time
I make notes, or dictate, as I walk up and down, such
whimsies as meet you here.' He cared little about
the look of their outsides, but thought a great deal
about their readiness to divert him; 'it is the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
<i>viaticum</i> I have yet found out for this human pilgrimage,
and I pity any man of understanding who
is not provided with it.' We have omitted the best
reason of all. One who has lived among his books
will love them because they are his own. Marie
Bashkirtseff expressed the matter well enough in a
page of her journal:&mdash;'I have a real passion for my
books, I arrange them, I count them, I gaze upon
them: my heart rejoices in nothing but this heap of
old books, and I like to stand off a little and look at
them as if they were a picture.'</p>

<h3>LATER COLLECTORS: FRANCE&mdash;ITALY&mdash;SPAIN.</h3>


<p>We have still to notice one or two of Grolier's
contemporaries, who may be classed as great book-collectors
of an old-fashioned type. They knew the
whole history of 'the Book,' and were themselves the
owners of exquisite treasures, which are now hoarded
up as the choicest remains of antiquity. But their
function was not so much to collect books as rare
and curious objects as to undertake the duty of saving
the records of past history from destruction. They
did the work in their day which has now devolved
upon the guardians of public and national libraries.
No private person could now take their place; but
the interests of literature could hardly have been protected
in a former age without the personal labour
and enthusiasm of Orsini and P&eacute;tau.</p>

<p>Fulvio Orsini was born in 1529. He began life as
a beggar, though for many years before his death he
was the leader of Italian learning. A poor girl had
been abandoned with her child and was forced to beg
her bread in the streets of Rome. The boy obtained
a place in the Lateran when he was only seven years
old: the Canon Delfini recognised his precocious
talents and undertook to find him a classical educa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>tion.
The student obtained some small preferment,
and succeeded to his patron's appointment. His
marvellous acquaintance with ancient books secured
him a place as librarian to the Cardinal Farnese, and
he received many offers of more lucrative employment: but
he found that if he accepted he would
have to live away from Rome; and he refused everything
that could cause inconvenience to his mother,
whose comfort was his constant care. On his death,
in the year 1600, he bequeathed his vast collections to
the Vatican, and the gift can only be compared to
such important events as the arrival of the spoils of
Urbino, or the great purchase of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> from the Queen
of Sweden.</p>

<p>Orsini has been ridiculed for having more books
than he could read, and for an excessive devotion to
the antique. 'Here is a library like an arsenal,' said
the satirist, 'stored with all the requisites for any
campaign. The owner buys all the books that come
in his way: it is true that he will not read them; but
he will have them magnificently bound, and ranged
on the shelves with a mighty show, and there he will
salute them several times a day, and will bring
his friends and servants to make their acquaintance.'
Orsini is rebuked for his admiration of a
dusty manuscript. 'When one of these old parchments
falls into his hands, he makes you examine
the decayed leaves on which the eye can hardly trace
any marks of an ancient pen. 'What is this treasure
that we have here?' he cries, 'and oh! what joy, here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
we have the delight of mankind, and the world's
desire, and pleasures not to be matched in Paradise!'
'There,' says our satirist, 'you have the very portrait
of Fulvio Orsini. Why, he once took a manuscript
<i>Terence</i>, full of holes and mistakes, in writing to
Cardinal Toletus, and told him that it was worth all
the gold in the world'; and, to convince his Spanish
Eminence, he said that the book was a thousand
years' old. '<i>Est-il possible?</i>' replies the Cardinal,
'you don't say so. I can only say, my friend, I would
rather have a book hot from the press than all the
old parchments that the Sibyl had for sale.'</p>

<p>Jacques Bongars, the faithful councillor and ambassador
of Henri Quatre, was the owner of a remarkable
library, consisting to a great extent of State
papers and historical documents, which Bongars had
special facilities for collecting during his official visits
to Germany. He had studied law at Bourges under
the learned Cujacius, of whom it is recorded that
when his name was mentioned in the German lecture-rooms,
every one present took off his hat. Bongars
has described his excitement at purchasing the great
lawyer's library. 'My chief care has been to seek out
the books belonging to Cujas. I expect that you
will have a fine laugh when you think of all that
crowd that goes to Court as if it were a fair, to do
their business together, and to try to get money out
of the King, while a regular courtier like myself rushes
off to this lonely spot to spend his fortune on books
and papers, all in disorder and half eaten by the book-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>worms.
You will be able to judge if I am an avaricious
man. No trouble or expense is anything to me
where books are concerned. Would to God that I were
free, and had time to read them. I should not feel
any envy then of M. de Rosny's wealth or the Persian's
mountain of gold.' While residing at Strasburg he
bought the manuscripts belonging to the Cathedral
from some of the soldiers by whom the city was more
than once pillaged during the wars of religion.</p>

<p>About the year 1603 Bongars arranged with Paul
P&eacute;tau for the joint purchase of a large collection of
manuscripts, which had belonged to the Abbey of St.
B&eacute;noit-sur-Loire, and had been saved by the bailiff
Pierre Daniel when the Abbey was plundered. The
share of Bongars in this collection was transferred to
Strasburg, and passed eventually with the rest of his
books to the public library of the city of Berne.</p>

<p>Paul P&eacute;tau was a man of universal accomplishments.
He was the rival of Scaliger in the science
of chronology; his doctrinal works are praised as 'a
monument of useful labour'; 'he solaced his leisure
hours with Greek and Hebrew, as well as Latin
verse,' and, according to Hallam's judgment, obtained
in the last subject the general approbation of the
critics. He formed a valuable museum of Greek,
Roman, and Gaulish antiquities, with a cabinet of
Frankish coins, to which Peiresc was a generous contributor.
His library contained several books that
had belonged to Grolier; but it was chiefly remarkable
for its <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, of which several were published by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Sirmond and Du Chesne among other materials for
the history of France. Many of them had been
acquired from the collection of Greek and Hebrew
books formed by Jean de Saint Andr&eacute;, or out of
the mass of chronicles, romances, and old French
poems belonging to Claude Fauchet, and a large
portion came, as we have seen, out of an ancient
Benedictine Abbey. Paul P&eacute;tau's books of all kinds
were left to his son Alexander. The printed books,
comprising a number of finely illustrated works on
arch&aelig;ology, were sold at the Hague in 1722; the
sale included the old library inherited by Francis
Mansard, and the <span class="smcap">mss.</span> relating to Roman antiquities
that had been the property of Lipsius. A thousand
splendid volumes on parchment, the pride of the
elder P&eacute;tau, described by all who saw them in terms
of glowing admiration, were sold in his son's lifetime
to Queen Christina of Sweden. She had always intended
to buy some great collection, and had thought
among others of buying up those of Henri de Mesmes,
of De B&eacute;thune, and the Cardinal Mazarin. She was
delighted with her new acquisition, and carried it off
to Rome, where she made a triumphal entry with her
books amidst the popular rejoicings.</p>

<p>Something may be learned about the Italian collectors
in the age that followed Grolier's death, from
the story of the strange wanderings of the manuscripts
of Leonardo da Vinci. Very little was known
upon this subject until M. Ars&egrave;ne Houssaye found
an account of what had happened among the papers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of the Barnabite Mazenta, who died in the year 1635.
'It was about fifty years ago,' says the memorandum,
written shortly before the old monk's death, 'that
thirteen volumes of Leonardo's papers, all written
backwards in his own way, fell into my hands. I
was then studying law at Pisa, and one of my companions
in the class-room was Aldus Manutius, renowned
as a book-collector. We received a visit
from one of his relations called Lelio Gavardi; he
had been tutor in the household of Francesco Melzi,
who was the pupil and also the heir of Leonardo.'
Melzi treasured up every line and scrap of the great
man's works at his country-house in Vaprio; but his
sons did not care for art, and left the papers lying
about in a lumber-room, so that Gavardi was able to
help himself as he pleased. He brought thirteen
volumes, well-known in the history of literature, as
far as Florence at first, and then to Aldus at Pisa.
'I cried shame on him,' said Mazenta, 'and as I was
going to Milan I undertook to return them to the
Melzi family. There I saw Doctor Horatio Melzi,
who was quite astonished at my taking so much
trouble, and gave me the books for myself, saying
that he had plenty more of the same sort in his
garrets at home.' When Mazenta became a monk
the thirteen volumes passed to his brothers, who
talked so much about the matter that there was a
rush of amateurs to Vaprio, and the Doctor was
overwhelmed with offers for the great man's books
and drawings. 'One of these rascals,' said Mazenta,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
'was the sculptor Pompeo Leoni, who used to make
the bronzes for the Escorial, and he pretended that
he would obtain an appointment for Melzi at Milan,
if he would get back the thirteen volumes for King
Philip's new library in Spain. Leoni got possession
of most of the books and kept them in his own
cabinet. One of the volumes was presented by
Mazenta's brother to the Ambrosian Library and
may still be seen there, in company with the huge
<i>Codice Atlantico</i>, which Leoni made up out of
hundreds of separate fragments. At Leoni's death
his collection was bought by Galeazzo Arcanati,
the illustrious owner of an artistic and literary
museum. He resisted the proposals of purchase
that poured in from foreign Courts; our James <span class="smcap">i.</span>
is said to have offered three thousand gold doubloons
for the great volume of designs; and on
Arcanati's death the whole collection was transferred
by his widow to the Ambrosiana. Some changes had
been made in the distribution of the papers since
Mazenta so easily acquired his thirteen books. The
French took the same number away in 1796; but
none of them ever returned, except the famous
<i>Codice Atlantico</i>.</p>

<p>In Spain there were but few persons interested in
books before the foundation of the Escorial towards the
end of the sixteenth century. We learn from Mariana
that soon after the year 1580 a vast gallery in the
palace was filled with books, mostly Greek <span class="smcap">mss.</span>,
which had been assembled from all parts of Europe;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
'its stores,' he said, 'are more precious than gold:
but it would be well if learned men had greater
facilities for reading them; for what profit is there
from learning if she is treated like a captive and
traitor?' Arias Montanus, the first Orientalist of
his age, was appointed librarian by the founder; he
was the owner of an immense quantity of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> in
Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, many of which were used
in his edition of the Antwerp Polyglott Bible, and
these he bequeathed to the Escorial, while his printed
books were left to the University of Seville.</p>

<p>The first book was printed in Valencia as early as
the year 1474; but the prospects of literature remained
dark until the termination of the Moorish
wars. On the capture of Granada it was thought
necessary to obliterate the memory of the Koran,
and scores of thousands of volumes, or a million as
some say, were destroyed by Cardinal Xim&egrave;nes in a
celebrated <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>. About three hundred Arabic
works on medicine were preserved for the new library
which the Cardinal was founding in his University of
Alcal&agrave;. The Cardinal spent vast sums in gathering
materials for his Mozarabic Missal and the great
Complutensian Polyglott. It is said that to avoid
future criticism he gave his Hebrew originals to be
used in the making of fireworks, just as Polydore
Vergil was accused in our country of burning the
monastic chronicles out of which he composed his
history, and as many Italian writers were believed
to have destroyed their classical authorities. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Petrarch lost his Cicero, it was thought that Alcionio
might have stolen it for his treatise upon exile; but we
should probably be right in rejecting all these stories
together as mere calumnies and 'forgeries of jealousy.'</p>

<p>Antonio Lebrixa, who worked under the Cardinal
till his death in 1522, had done much to revive a
knowledge of books, and may be regarded as the
principal agent in the introduction of the new Italian
learning. His pupil Ferdinand Nu&ntilde;ez, or Nonnius
as he is often called, carried on the good work at
Salamanca, and left his great library to the University.
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza was one of the
most distinguished students who ever followed the
lectures there. As a poet he has been called the
Spanish Sallust: as the author of the adventures of
Lazarillo de Tormes he takes a high place among
the lighter authors of romance; and as a patron of
learning he will always be remembered for having
enriched the Escorial with his transcripts from Mount
Athos, and six chests of valuable <span class="smcap">mss.</span> which he
received in return for ransoming from his captivity at
Venice the son of Soliman the Magnificent. Great
credit must also be given to Don Ferdinand Columbus
for his good work at Seville. The son of the great
Admiral and Donna Beatrix Enriquez was one of
the most celebrated bibliophiles in Europe. He
began making his collections very soon after his
father's death. Between 1510 and 1537 he had visited
Italy several times, and had travelled besides in
England and France, in the Low Countries and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Germany, buying books wherever he went. His
great object was to procure illuminated <span class="smcap">mss.</span> and
early editions of romances and miracle-plays; but he
was also fond of the classics, and his library at Seville
is still possessed of many copies of Latin poets and
orators which are full of his marginal notes. At
Louvain he became acquainted with Nicholas
Cl&eacute;nard, who was lecturing there on Greek and
Hebrew, and was just commencing the Arabic studies
by which his name became famous. Don Ferdinand
had a commission to bring back professors for the
University of Salamanca, where learning was beginning
to revive; and Cl&eacute;nard was easily induced to
visit a country which might contain the relics of
Moorish culture. Ferrari, as we know, was very
successful in the next generation in finding rare
books in Spain for Borromeo's Ambrosian library. At
Bruges, Don Ferdinand met Jean Vas&eacute;e, a man just
suited for an appointment as librarian, and he too
was persuaded to accompany the traveller on his
return. Don Ferdinand established a large library
in his house at Seville. Cl&eacute;nard helped to arrange
the books, and Vas&eacute;e became librarian. The volumes
amounted at least to fifteen thousand in number,
though the exact amount remains unknown owing to
discrepancies in the earliest catalogues.</p>

<p>Don Ferdinand hoped that the library would be
kept up by the family of Columbus. With that
object he left it to his great-nephew Don Luis, with
an annuity to provide for the expenses; if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
legacy were refused, it was to pass to the Chapter of
the Cathedral at Seville, with alternative provisions
in favour of the Monastery of San Pablo. As events
turned out, the succession was not taken up on behalf
of his young kinsman, and after some litigation the
Fernandina, or 'La Colombina' as it was afterwards
called, was adjudged to the Chapter of Seville and
placed in a room by the Moorish Aisle at the Giralda.
Owing chiefly to the generosity of Queen Isabella
and the Duc de Montpensier the library of 'La
Colombina' has been restored to prosperity, although
according to Mr. Ford it was long abandoned to 'the
canons and book-worms.' It appears that in the
middle of the last century three-quarters of the <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
had been destroyed by rough usage or by the water
dripping in from the gutters; the books were in
charge of the men who swept the Church, and they
allowed the school-children to play with the illustrated
volumes and to tear out the miniatures and woodcuts.
Mr. Harrisse has described with much detail
the grandeur and the decline of this celebrated institution,
and he gives reasons for supposing that it
may have suffered even in recent years from the
negligence of its guardians. It is satisfactory, however,
to find that its most precious contents have
passed safely through every period of danger; the
library still contains some of the books of Christopher
Columbus, and especially the <i>Imago Mundi</i> with
his marginal notes about the Portuguese discoveries,
'in all which things,' he writes 'I had my share.'</p>

<h3>DE THOU&mdash;PINELLI&mdash;PEIRESC.</h3>


<p>It was long a saying among the French that a man
had never seen Paris who had not looked upon the
books of Thuanus. The historian Jacques-Auguste
de Thou held a leading place in literature, without
pretending in any way to rival the greatness of
Joseph Scaliger or the erudition of Isaac Casaubon.
He was the master of a great store of personal and
secret history collected in state papers and records;
but he was also famous for the extent of his general
scholarship, and for the patronage which he manifested
towards all who laboured about books. He
was himself a most fastidious collector. He never
heard of the appearance of a valuable work without
ordering three or four copies on the fine paper manufactured
for his private use; and of any such book
already issued he would order several sets of sheets to
be taken to pieces in order to procure one perfect
example. His library was not large. It consisted of
about 8000 printed books and 1000 manuscripts,
chiefly upon historical subjects; but they were all
well selected, well bound, and in perfect condition.
There is a letter upon this subject by Henri Estienne
the printer, in which the high reputation of De Thou's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
library is contrasted with Lucian's just invective
against the illiterate book-hunter: 'The satirist would
have honoured a man like you, so learned and so
generous in your library: you choose your books
with taste, and proportion the cost of binding to the
price of the volume; and Lucian, I am sure, would
have praised your carefulness in these respects.'</p>

<p>In all matters connected with literature De Thou
was helped by his friend 'Pith&oelig;us,' of whom it was
said that no one knew any particular author as well
as Pierre Pithou knew all the classics. By talent and
hard work combined Pithou had 'distilled the quintessence
of wisdom' out of the garnered stores of
antiquity. Upon his death De Thou was inclined to
give up his books and the work that had made life
pleasant. He wrote in that strain to his associate
Isaac Casaubon. 'On the loss of my incomparable
friend, the partner of my cares and my counsellor in
letters and politics, the web that I was weaving
fell from my hand, and I should not have
resumed my history were it not a tribute to the
memory of one who has done so much for me.'</p>

<p>De Thou's end was hastened by the death of his
wife. Those who know the look of his books,
stamped with a series of his family quarterings, will
remember that he was first married to Marie Barban&ccedil;on,
and afterwards to Gasparde de la Chastre. 'I had
always hoped and prayed,' he wrote at the commencement
of his will, 'that my dearest Gaspara Chastr&aelig;a
would have outlived me.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Admonished by her loss to set his affairs in order
he began to take special pains in providing for the
future of his books. He anticipated the public
spirit of Cardinal Richelieu, to whom the merit is
often assigned of having been the first to bequeath the
use of his library to scholars. The Cardinal was not
particular about the methods by which he amassed
his literary wealth: he is said to have increased his
store by all the arts of cajolery, and even by bare
intimidation; and he may have wished to make some
amends by directing that 'persons of erudition'
should have access to his books after his death. De
Thou had an equal love of books, and showed
perhaps a kinder feeling about the use of the treasures
which his own care had accumulated. 'It is important,'
he wrote, 'for my own family and for the
cause of learning that the library should be kept together
which I have been for more than forty years
collecting, and I hereby forbid any division, sale, or
dispersion thereof; I bequeath it to such of my sons
as shall apply themselves to literature, and they shall
hold it in common, but so that it shall be free to all
scholars at home or abroad. I leave its custody to
Pierre du Puy until my sons are grown up, and he
shall have authority to lend out the <span class="smcap">mss.</span> under
proper security for their safe return.'</p>

<p>Pierre and Jacques du Puy, the 'two Puteani' as they
were often called, were the sons of a distinguished
bibliophile, Charles du Puy, who died in 1594, and
were themselves the leaders in a curious department<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of book-learning. Their father was the founder
of a library enriched by his care with the best
specimens of early printing and a few rare <span class="smcap">mss.</span> In
the latter class he possessed an ancient bilingual
copy of St. Paul's Epistles, a Livy in uncial
characters, and the precious fragments of the Vatican
Virgil, which he gave to Fulvio Orsini in his lifetime.
'On his death,' says M. Guigard, 'the bibliographical
succession passed to Pierre and Jacques, his younger
sons, the first a Councillor of State, the other Prior
of St. Sauveur-les-Bray, and both employed as
guardians of the books in the Royal Library. No
two men were ever more ardently devoted to the
interests of learning. They worked in concert at
increasing and improving their father's library; but
their chief object was to accumulate and preserve
the obscurer materials of history. The <i>Collection Du
Puy</i>, which has now became national property, comprised
more than 800 volumes of fugitive pieces,
memoirs, instructions, pedigrees, letters, and all the
other miscellaneous documents that were classed by
D'Israeli 'under the vague title of State Papers.'
It has been said that the object of their 'Titanic
labour' was to ease the way for the historian De
Thou; but it is more likely that the brothers obeyed
an instinct for the acquisition of secret history; 'life
would have been too short to have decided on the
intrinsic value of the manuscripts flowing down in a
stream to the collectors.' The surviving brother
bequeathed these State Papers to the Abb&eacute; de Thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
(the fourth possessor of the 'Bibliotheca Thuana') who
sold them to Charron de M&eacute;nars; they were
eventually purchased by Louis <span class="smcap">xvi.</span>, and were deposited
in the Royal Library, where the printed
books and certain other <span class="smcap">mss.</span> had been already
received under a legacy from Jacques du Puy.</p>

<p>When the historian died the brothers jointly undertook
the trust that had fallen to Pierre. 'Among all
the French scholars,' said Gassendi,'these two Puteani
do most excel; and now, abiding with the sons of
Thuanus, they sustain by all the means in their
power the library and the students that have been
committed to their care. Fran&ccedil;ois-Auguste de Thou,
the historian's eldest son, became Grand-Master of
the King's books; he added considerably to the
'Bibliotheca Thuana,' and his house became the
meeting-place of the Parisian <i>savants</i>. A brilliant
career was cruelly cut short by the malignity of
Richelieu.</p>

<p>The young Cinq-Mars was in a plot with the Queen
and Gaston of Orl&eacute;ans to overthrow the Cardinal's
power. His friend De Thou was aware of the design,
but had taken no part in the conspiracy. The
Cardinal arrested them both, and dragged them along
the Rhone in a boat attached to his own barge; and
De Thou was executed as a scapegoat, while most of
the leaders saved their lives. The Cardinal died soon
afterwards, without having confiscated the library;
and it passed to Jacques-Auguste, the historian's
younger son, who by a tardy act of grace had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
restored to the civil rights enjoyed by his brother
before his unjust conviction. He was by all accounts
as great a book-collector as his father; and he had
the good fortune to marry an heiress, Marie Picardet,
who brought with her a large quantity of books from
her father's house in Britanny. In the year 1677 the
'Bibliotheca Thuana' with all its additions passed to
the Abb&eacute; Jacques-Auguste de Thou, who was soon
afterwards compelled to part with it to the Pr&eacute;sident
Charron de M&eacute;nars. St. Simon praised its new
owner as a most worthy and honourable nonentity;
but he had the sense to step into the breach and to
save the 'Thuana' from destruction. When he sold
the library to the Cardinal de Rohan, in 1706, he
reserved the <i>Collection Du Puy</i> for his daughters. It
is believed that the Cardinal, through the cleverness
of his secretary Oliva, obtained the historian's choice
examples for less than the price of the binding. We
must follow the career of the collection to its melancholy
end. The Cardinal left it to his nephew the
Prince de Soubise. The world knows him as the
inventor of a sauce and as the general in one lost
battle; but he had a higher fame among the booksellers
for his prowess in the auction-room. He seems
to have been the victim of a frenzy for books. He
impressed them by crowds, and marshalled them in
regiments and myriads. They all fell in 1789 before
the hammer of the auctioneer. Dibdin has described
the catalogue. It was unostentatious and printed on
indifferent material. He hoped, with his curious in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>sistance
on the point, that there were 'some few copies
on large paper.' It is a mark of the changes in book-collecting
that Dibdin praised the index as excellent,
'enabling us to discover any work of which we may be
in want'; but it is now regarded as remarkable for its
poverty, and especially for the extraordinary carelessness
that left eight noble specimens from Grolier's
library without the slightest mark of distinction.</p>

<p>Gian-Vincenzio Pinelli was a celebrated man of
letters whose library at Padua formed 'a perpetual
Academy' for all the scholars of his day. Born at
Naples in 1538, he spent the greater part of his long
life at Padua, where he was sent to study the law; but
the only sign of his professional labours appears to
have been that he rigidly excluded all works on
jurisprudence from his magnificent library. His
books, says Hallam, were collected by the labours of
many years: 'the catalogues of the Frankfort fairs
and those of the principal booksellers in Italy were
diligently perused, nor did any work of value appear
from the press on either side of the Alps which he
did not instantly add to his shelves.' Remembering
the traditions of the age of Poggio, when the rarest
classics might be found perishing in a garret or a
cellar, Pinelli was always in the habit of visiting the
dealers in old parchment and the brokers who carried
off deeds and papers from sales, just as Dr. Rawlinson
collected and gave to the Bodleian a mass of unsorted
documents, including, as we have seen, even the logs
of recent voyages, and the pickings of "grocers'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
waste-paper." In each case the industry of the collector
was constantly rewarded by the discovery of
valuable literary materials, which would have been
lost under ordinary circumstances. The library of
Pinelli was augmented by that of his friend Paul
Aicardo, the two <i>literati</i> having entered into an
undertaking that the survivor should possess the
whole fruit of their labours. On Pinelli's death, in
1601, his family determined to transfer his books to
Naples. The Venetian government interfered on the
ground that, though Pinelli had been allowed to copy
the archives and registers of the State, it had never
been intended that the information should be communicated
to a foreign power. Their magistrate
seized a hundred bales of books, of which fourteen
were packed with <span class="smcap">mss.</span> On examination it appeared
that there were about three hundred volumes of
political commentaries, dealing with the affairs of all
the Italian States; and it was arranged, by way of
compromise, that these should remain at Padua in a
repository under the charge of an official guardian.
The rest of the library was despatched in three
shiploads from Genoa. One vessel was captured
by pirates, and the cargo was thrown overboard,
only a few volumes being afterwards cast ashore.
The other ships arrived safely at Naples; but it
appears that the new proprietors had little taste for
literature. The whole remaining stock was found
some years afterwards in a mouldy garret, packed in
ninety bales; and it was purchased at last for 3000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
crowns by Cardinal Frederic Borromeo, who used it as
the basis for the Ambrosian Library which he was at
that time establishing in Milan. Another library was
afterwards founded at Venice by members of the
Pinelli family engaged in the Levantine trade. On
the death of its last possessor, Maffeo Pinelli, in 1787,
the collection was sold to a firm of English booksellers.
It seems by Dibdin's account to have been in a poor
condition, though Dr. Harwood declared that, 'there
being no dust in Venice,' it had reposed for some
centuries in excellent preservation. This immense
body of books was re-sold in London two years afterwards
at prices which barely covered the expenses
incurred, though a large amount was obtained for a
copy of the Polyglott Bible of Xim&egrave;nes in six folio
volumes printed upon vellum.</p>

<p>The praises of the great Pinelli were spread abroad
by Scaliger, De Thou, and Casaubon; but his memory,
perhaps, has been best preserved by the ardent friendship
of Peiresc. He was visited at Padua by the
young philosopher in whose mind he found a reflection
of his own; and it was generally agreed that the
lamp of learning had passed into safe hands when it
was yielded by Pinelli to the student from Provence.
Nicolas Fabry de Peiresc belonged to an ancient
family established near Aix. His father had been
selected by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Louise'">Louis</ins> <span class="smcap">xii.</span> to share the education
of the Princess Ren&eacute;e. A man of learning himself,
he spared no expense in the boy's instruction, who
became celebrated even in his childhood for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
strength of his precocious intellect. The most
eminent professors in Italy combined to exalt 'the
ripe excellence of his unripe years'; and when Pinelli
died it was said that Peiresc had taken the helm of
knowledge and was guiding the ship as he pleased.
He explored at leisure the riches of Florence and
Rome, and afterwards watched the rise of the 'Ambrosiana'
at Milan. A letter from Joseph Scaliger,
who ruled literary Europe like a King, from his chair
at Leyden, sent Peiresc off to Verona, where he
hunted up evidence in support of the wild story that
the Scaligers were the representatives of the Ducal
line of La Scala.</p>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar Scaliger, the father of the great philologist,
had amused the world by claiming to be the
son of Benedetto and Berenice della Scala, to have
been a page of the Emperor Maximilian, and to have
fought in the Battle of Ravenna; and he pretended
that he had become a Cordelier, so as to rise to the
Papal throne and expel the Venetians from his
dominions. Peiresc was by no means a believer in
this extraordinary romance; but he did his best to
collect the coins, epitaphs, and pedigrees, which
might please his learned correspondent. Crossing
the Alps, we are told, 'he viewed the Lake of Geneva
and made a tour through a multitude of books'; and
returned to Aix with a library and cabinet of gems,
'thinking to himself that he would never see such
plenty again.' When he visited Paris in 1605, his
first object, he said, was to see the illustrious De<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Thou, to thank him for his kind letters, and to
enquire for messages from Scaliger. 'I cannot
express,' he repeats, 'how joyfully he entertained
me.' De Thou took down his books for the visitor,
and showed him the records under lock and key that
contained the secrets of his history, 'opening his very
heart, and brimful of a wonderful sincerity.' Next
day Casaubon came in from the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que du Roi</i>,
and showed much pleasure at being introduced to
the traveller. His letters of a later date show his
high esteem for Peiresc. 'I am eagerly waiting to
hear what Scaliger will say about the antiques, but
I foresee that you will have room to glean after his
harvest.' On another occasion he wrote: 'I do not
know if you heard that the Duke of Urbino has sent
me the Polybius, but I am indeed most beholden to
you for the kindness.'</p>

<p>Ten years afterwards Peiresc came to Paris again,
wishing to explore the Oriental treasures in the
library of De Mesmes, and to visit the huge collections
in the houses of St. Victor and St. Germain.
Here he gained the friendship of Pierre S&eacute;guier and
the elegant Nicolas Rigault, and of J&eacute;rome Bignon,
the first of a long dynasty of librarians. In England
he saw the Bodleian, and talked with Savile, and
admired Sir Robert Cotton as 'an honestly curious
sort of man.' In Holland his chief business was to
visit Scaliger, and we are told that he was careful
not to ask about the treatise on squaring the circle,
or to hint any doubt as to the truth of the Verona<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
romance. Here at Leyden he read in the great
library, soon to be endowed with Scaliger's books,
and saw the room of which Heinsius so nobly said:
'In the very bosom of Eternity among all these
illustrious souls I take my seat'; and at Louvain he
could only lament the death of Justus Lipsius, whom
he regarded as 'the light and the loadstar of
wisdom.'</p>

<p>Gassendi has left us an account of the library
collected by Peiresc. Besides his acquisitions in the
East, of which we have spoken elsewhere, the books
came in crowds from his agents in France and
Germany, and his scribes in the Vatican and Escorial.
'When any library was to be sold by public outcry,
he took care to buy the best books, especially if they
were of some neat edition that he did not already
possess.' He bound them in red morocco with his
cypher or initials in gold. One binder always lived
in the house, and sometimes several were employed
at once, 'when the books came rolling in on every
side.' He would even bind up bits of old volumes
and worm-eaten leaves; good books, he said, were
so badly used by the vulgar, that he would try to
have them prized at least for their beauty, and so
perhaps they might escape the hands of the tobacconist
and the grocer. A treatise published by Jerome
Alexander contained a wonderful description of the
establishment. 'Your house and library,' says the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dedication are'">dedication, 'are</ins> a firmament wherein the stars of learning
shine: the desks are lit with star-light and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
books are in constellations: and you sit like the sun
in the midst, embracing and giving light to them all.'
Peiresc was anxious to circulate the book, which
contained a rare treatise by Hesychius; but he took
care to compose another dedication, which was printed
and inserted without comment.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his profuse purchases he did not
leave a large collection at his death. His friends
complained that he lent 'a world of books' that were
never returned, and that he was especially lavish of
any works that could be replaced by purchase. 'About
ten years after his death,' says his friend Lemontey,
'his relations brought his books to Paris, where I
saw them in 1647; they formed a great company of
volumes, most curiously bound. They ought to have
been sold <i>en bloc</i>, but as the Genius of the library had
fled, the Fates ordained that they should be torn
asunder.' Most of the books were purchased for the
Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre. A great number of the <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
were destroyed, though there are still a few volumes
in the public library at Carpentras. These were
purchased from Louis Thomassin, a member of
Peiresc's family, by Don Malachi d'Inguimbert,
librarian to Pope Clement <span class="smcap">xii.</span>, who founded the
collection of Carpentras when he became Bishop
of the diocese. There is a tradition that Peiresc's
correspondence, containing many thousands of documents,
was destroyed by his grand-niece, 'a kind of
female Omar,' who insisted in using the papers for
lighting fires and making trays for her silk-worms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Peiresc employed some of the most learned men
of his time to collect for him in Italy. Jacques
Gaffarel, who had been engaged in similar work for
Richelieu, was his principal agent in Rome. At
Padua he was so fortunate as to secure the services
of the arch&aelig;ologist Tomasini. But his correspondence
shows that the prince of librarians, Gabriel
Naud&eacute;, was at once his agent, his adviser, and his
friend; and it is from Naud&eacute; that we take the words
of grief which remain as the scholar's memorial. 'Oh
cruel Fate and bitter Death, thrust into the midst of
our jollity! Was there ever a man, I pray you, more
skilled in history and philology, more ready to assist
the student, more endowed with wit and wealth and
worth, the equipment of any man who, like Peiresc,
is to hold the world of letters at his beck and call.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>FRENCH COLLECTORS&mdash;NAUD&Eacute; TO RENOUARD.</h3>


<p>Gabriel Naud&eacute; was a Doctor of Medicine, and
held an appointment at one time as physician in
ordinary to Louis <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> But even as a student
he manifested that passion for books which furnished
the real occupation of his life. Before taking his
degree at Padua he was librarian to Henri de
Mesmes, and afterwards to Cardinal Bagni at Rome.
On his patron's death he was placed in charge of the
great library which Cardinal Barberini was establishing
in his palace in the Piazza of the Quattro Fontane.
Some part of his time was spent in collecting books
for Cardinal Richelieu, who offered Naud&eacute; the charge
of his library in 1642; but, the Cardinal having died
in that year, Naud&eacute; transferred his services to Mazarin.
He inspired his employer with the desire of emulating
the magnificence of Barberini and the patriotic
generosity of Borromeo; and the librarian's keen
scent for books and minute knowledge of their values
were thenceforth utilised in the work of creating the
<i>Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine</i>.</p>

<p>Richelieu had done things on a grand scale. He
had confiscated to his own use the whole town-library<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
at La Rochelle; and Naud&eacute; was anxious that Mazarin's
great undertaking should begin with an acquisition
<i>en bloc</i>. A provincial governor named Simeon Dubois
had made a collection in the Limousin. His books
had passed into the hands of Jean Descordes, a Canon
of Limoges, who died in 1642 possessed of about 6000
volumes. Naud&eacute; prepared the catalogue, and persuaded
the Cardinal to purchase the whole property
by private contract. A few months afterwards the
King gave him the State Papers collected by Antoine
de Lom&eacute;nie. A great number of printed books were
added under Naud&eacute;'s superintendence, and in a short
time the new library was opened to the public. Its
regulations were framed in a very liberal spirit, as
may be learned from the first of Naud&eacute;'s rules: 'The
library is to be open to all the world without the
exception of any living soul; readers will be supplied
with chairs and writing-materials, and the attendants
will fetch all books required in any language or
department of learning, and will change them as often
as is necessary.'</p>

<p>In reviewing the condition of the other great
libraries, Naud&eacute; pointed out that there was nothing
like an unrestrained admission except at the Bodleian,
the Ambrosian, and the Angelica Library at Rome.
The public had no rights at the Vatican, or the
Laurentian, or the Library of St. Mark at Venice.
It was just the same at Bologna, or Naples, or in the
Duchy of Urbino. The same thing, he said, might
be seen in other countries. Xim&egrave;nes built a fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
library at Alcal&agrave;, and there was a collection of the
books of Nu&ntilde;ez at Salamanca; there were the
Rantzaus at Copenhagen and the Fuggers at Augsburg;
they had done everything for the use of
scholars except making the libraries free. The
French themselves had the King's Library, a vast
accumulation at St. Victor's, and a rich bequest from
De Thou; but the use of all this wealth of books was
hampered by the most complicated restrictions. We
can see that he was rejoicing in his own good work
while he praised the stately Ambrosiana. 'Is it not
astonishing,' he asks, 'that any one can go in when he
likes, and stay as long as he cares to look about or to
read or make extracts? All that he has to do is to sit
at a desk and ask for any book that he wishes to
study.'</p>

<p>For some years after the new library was established
Naud&eacute; travelled in quest of books over the
greater part of Europe. He said that he would have
ransacked Spain if Mazarin had not preferred an
invasion by the regular army. He was the 'familiar
spirit' of the auction-room, and it became a by-word
that a visit from the great book-hunter was as bad as a
storm in the book-shops. He boasted in his epigrams
of exploits in Flanders, in Switzerland, and among
the Venetian book-stalls. At Rome he bought books
by the fathom; he skimmed the German shelves, and
passed over into England to relieve the islanders of
their riches. At Lyons he met Marshal Villeroi, who
gave him a great portion of the books which Cardinal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
de Tournon had bequeathed to the Jesuits. We trace
the result of his travels in his description of the
libraries of Europe. Certain subjects, as he said, are
in vogue at particular places, and we ought always to
notice the book-fashions to show our respect for the
feelings of mankind. 'For positive science we go to
Rome or Florence or Naples, and for jurisprudence
to Paris or Milan; France supplies us with history;
and if we wanted scholastic lore we might go to
Spain, or the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge.'</p>

<p>In 1647 the Mazarine Library contained about
45,000 volumes, and Naud&eacute; in his joy proclaimed it
as the eighth wonder of the world. The Parisians
appeared to be delighted with the superb Lom&eacute;nie
<span class="smcap">mss.</span> and the crowd of bright volumes in the Cardinal's
ordinary livery. But in 1651 the Parliament got the
upper hand of the 'Red Tyrant' in one of the unmeaning
struggles of the Wars of the Fronde; the
property of Mazarin was confiscated for a time, and
the library was put up for sale. The list of Commissioners
included the respectable names of Alexandre
P&eacute;tau and Pierre Pithou; yet we are assured
that the auction resembled a massacre, and that
hardly any obstacle was placed in the way of the
most impudent thefts. Naud&eacute; in vain petitioned
against a decree which had fallen like a thunder-bolt
on the 'wonderful work of his life.' 'Why will you
not save this daughter of mine, this library that is the
fairest and best-endowed in the world? Can you permit
the public to be deprived of such a precious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
useful treasure? Can you endure that this fair flower,
which spreads its perfume through the world, should
wither as you hold it in your hands?'</p>

<p>Naud&eacute; spent his own small fortune in ransoming
the books on medicine. He had worked hard to persuade
Queen Christina to purchase the whole collection;
but when it came to the point she only bought
a few <span class="smcap">mss.</span> which were afterwards returned. The
'Pallas of the North,' was interested in Naud&eacute;'s
misfortunes. She invited him to take charge of the
Royal Library at Stockholm, and here he rested for a
while. He made acquaintance in Sweden with several
celebrated men of letters; Descartes was a guest at
the Court, and used to be ready to begin his metaphysical
discourses at day-break. Naud&eacute; on one
occasion delighted the young Queen by stepping a
Greek dance with Professor Meibomius, who was
just at that time bringing out his work upon the music
of the ancients. The climate, or the excitement of
that vivacious Court, began to disagree with Naud&eacute;'s
health; he resigned his appointment and returned to
France, but died at Abbeville on his way to Paris, a
few months before his patron's return to power.
When the public library was established again the
Cardinal purchased Naud&eacute;'s private collection of
8000 books; and care was taken to preserve them
apart, as a mark of distinction, in a gallery named
after the famous librarian.</p>

<p>The hereditary collections of Colbert and La
Moignon were as much indebted to their librarians as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the Mazarine to the labours of Naud&eacute;. The Minister
Jean-Baptiste Colbert was as celebrated for his books
as for his finance: but the magnificence of the library
was mainly due to its guardian Calcavi and his successor
the venerable Baluze. Colbert's manuscripts
are believed to have been the most valuable ever
amassed by a person of private fortune. Among
their eight thousand volumes were the choicest
treasures from St. Martin's Abbey at Metz, including
the <i>Book of Hours</i> used by Charles the Great, and a
Bible said to have been illuminated for Charles the
Bald. There were about 50,000 printed books, almost
all well-bound; and it was thought that the choicest
Levantine moroccos had been secured for the
Minister by an article in a treaty with the Sultan.
Colbert died in 1683, and the library remained in his
family for half a century afterwards. In 1728 the
Marquis de Seignelaye sold the books, and began
to sell a portion of the manuscripts; the world was
alarmed at the idea of a general dispersion; the
remaining manuscripts, however, were offered to
Louis <span class="smcap">xv.</span>; and there was great rejoicing when he
wrote '<i>Bon, 300,000 livres</i>' on the letter received
from the Marquis.</p>

<p>The other famous library was amassed by 'an extraordinary
family of book-collectors.' It was begun
by Guillaume de la Moignon, who was President of
the Parliament of Paris in 1658. His son Chr&eacute;tien
de la Moignon was as zealous a book-buyer as his
father, and he secured the renown of their library by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
engaging the services of Adrien Baillet. Dibdin
quoted passages from Baillet's biography that show
the tenderness with which the family treated his
'crazy body and nervous mind': 'Madame La
Moignon and her son always took a pleasure in anticipating
his wishes, soothing his irritabilities, promoting
his views, and speaking loudly and constantly
of the virtues of his head and heart.' Baillet in his
turn gave to his employers the credit of his best
literary work. 'It was done for you,' he wrote, 'and
in your house, and by one who is ever yours to command.'
The library was much enlarged by its owner
in the third generation; and by its union with the
collection of M. Berryer, who died in 1762, it became
'one of the most splendid in Europe.' It was dispersed
during the troubles of the Revolution, and a
great portion was brought to London in 1791; but
the works on jurisprudence were reserved, and were
sold in Paris a few years afterwards.</p>

<p>David Ancillon is perhaps best known as the
defender of Luther and Calvin. But according to
Bayle he was an indefatigable book-collector, and
notable for having set the fashion of buying books in
the first edition. Most people thought, said D'Israeli,
that the first edition was only an imperfect essay,
'which the author proposes to finish after trying
the sentiments of the literary world.' Bayle was on
the side of Ancillon. There are cases, as he remarked,
in which the second edition has never appeared; and
at any rate the man who waits for the reprint shows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
'that he loves a pistole better than knowledge.'
Ancillon, however, always indulged himself with 'the
most elegant edition,' whatever the first might have
been; he considered that 'the less the eyes are
fatigued in reading or work the more liberty the mind
feels in judging of it.' It is easier to detect the merits
in print than in manuscript: 'and so we see them more
plainly in good paper and clear type than when the
impression and paper are <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bad?'">bad?'</ins> Some have thought
it better to have many editions of a good book:
'among other things,' says our critic, 'we feel great
satisfaction in tracing the variations.' Ancillon was
naturally accused of an indiscriminate mania for
collecting; and he confessed that he was to some
extent infected with the 'book-disease.' It was said
that he never left his books day or night, except
when he went to preach to his humble congregation.
He was convinced that some golden thought might
be found in the dullest work. Ancillon remained in
France as long as his religion was tolerated. He
found a home across the Rhine after the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes; but from that time he had to
be content with German editions, all his fine tall
volumes having been destroyed by the 'Catholic'
rioters at Metz.</p>

<p>If Evelyn can be believed, the art of book-collecting
had come to a very poor pass in France about the
seventeenth century. It had been discovered that
certain classes of books were the necessary furniture of
every gentleman's library. If a man of quality built a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
mansion he would expect to find a book-room and a
quantity of shelves; it was a simple matter further
on to order so many yards of folios or octavos, all in
red morocco, with the coat of arms stamped in gold.
Such collections, said La Bruy&egrave;re, are like a picture-gallery
with a strong smell of leather: the owner is
most polite in showing off 'the gold leaves, Etruscan
bindings, and fine editions'; 'we thank him for his
kindness, but care as little as himself to visit the tan-yard
which he calls his library.' We must not forget
the financier Bretonvilliers, who about the year 1657
determined to become a bibliophile, and so far succeeded
that some of his local books on Lorraine were
purchased for the National Library. He first built a
H&ocirc;tel, not far from the Cathedral of Notre-Dame,
with a large gallery in which with infinite pains he
built up a magnificent book-case; the contents were
of less importance; but he succeeded after a time in
filling it with books stamped with his new device of
an eagle holding the olive-branch.</p>

<p>One or two of the more serious collectors may be
noticed before we pass to the great age of Rothelin
and La Valli&egrave;re. Henri du Bouchet had gathered
about eight thousand books, all very well chosen,
according to the testimony of the P&egrave;re Jacob; on his
death in 1654 he bequeathed them to the Abbey
of St. Victor on public trusts so that those who
came after him might find a solace in what had been
'his dearest delight.' He requested that they might
be free to students for three days in the week and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
seven hours in the day; and his wishes were duly
regarded until the great library of St. Victor was dispersed
in 1791. The monks set up a tablet and bust
in memory of the generous donor; and perceiving
that the volumes were not emblazoned in the usual
way they adopted the singular plan of inserting pieces
of leather bearing his arms into holes cut in the
ancient bindings.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Boisot was another of the scholars who
lived entirely for books. While quite a young man
he acquired a considerable library in his travels
through Spain and Italy; and in 1664, during an
official visit to Besan&ccedil;on, he was so fortunate as to
acquire the <span class="smcap">mss.</span> of the Cardinal de Granvelle, who
had been the confidential minister of the Emperor
Charles <span class="smcap">v.</span> Boisot wrote a delightful account of
the adventures through which this collection had
passed. 'At first,' he says, 'the servants used what
they pleased, and then the neighbours' children helped
themselves; when some packing-cases were wanted,
the butler, to show his economy, sold the records
contained in them to a grocer.' At last they were all
tired of these 'useless old papers,' and determined to
throw them away. Jules Chifflet, according to
Guigard, was the means of saving the remainder.
He examined a number of the documents and recognised
their importance, though they were mostly in
cipher; but he died before they could be sorted out.
Boisot bought what he could from the heirs, and
found a good many more <span class="smcap">mss.</span> in the neighbourhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
They passed with the rest of Boisot's books to the
Abbey of St. Vincent at Besan&ccedil;on; and during the
Revolution the whole collection became the property
of the citizens and was transferred to the public
library.</p>

<p>The hereditary treasures of the Bouhier family were
dispersed in the same way through several provincial
libraries. The collection had begun in the reign of
Louis <span class="smcap">xii.</span>, and something had been done in each
generation afterwards by way of adding fine books
and manuscripts. &Eacute;tienne Bouhier had collected in
all parts of Italy. Jean Bouhier in 1642 bought the
accumulations of Pontus de Thyard, the learned
Bishop of Ch&acirc;lons. His father's own library had been
dispersed among his children; but Jean Bouhier
succeeded in getting it together again, and added a
large number of <span class="smcap">mss.</span> which he had gathered for the
illustration of the history of Burgundy. The library
became still more famous in the time of his grandson
the President Jean Bouhier, who has been admired
as the type of the true bibliophile. The bibliomaniac
heaps up books from avarice or some animal instinct;
he is a collector, it is said, 'without intelligent
curiosity.' Bouhier used to read his books and make
notes upon them; and it is said that he carried the
practice to such excess as to deface with marginal
scribblings the finest work of Henri Estienne and
Antoine V&eacute;rard. A visitor to his library described
the sober magnificence of the rosewood shelves with
silken hangings in which the rare editions and long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rows of manuscripts were ranged. In the next
generation there was a startling change. The library
had been left to Bouhier's son-in-law, Chartraire de
Bourbonne: the grave offspring of Aldus and Gryphius
found themselves in company with poets of the <i>talon
rouge</i> and muses of the <i>Op&eacute;ra bouffe</i>. When the gay
De Bourbonne died, the ill-assorted crowd passed to
his son-in-law in his turn, and was transferred in 1784
to the Abbey of Clairvaux.</p>

<p>We cannot name or classify the bibliophiles of the
eighteenth century. It would be endless to describe
them with the briefest of personal notes; how M. Barr&eacute;
loved out-of-the-way books and fugitive pieces, or
Lambert de Thorigny a good history, or how Gabriel
de Sartines, the policeman of the Parc aux Cerfs, had
a marvellous collection about Paris. When Count
Macarthy sold his books at Toulouse his catalogue contained
a list of about ninety others, issued in the same
century, from which his riches were derived. We can
point to a few of the mightiest Nimrods. We see
the serene Gaignat pass, and the bustling La Valli&egrave;re;
the Duc d'Estr&eacute;es is recognised as a busy book-hunter,
and there are the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'physicans'">physicians</ins> Hyacinthe Baron and
Falconnet whose keenness no prey could escape. We
can distinguish the forms of the elegant '<i>bibliomanes</i>'
to whom their books were as pictures or as
jewels to be enclosed in a shrine; there is Count
d'Hoym with a house full of treasures, and Boisset
and Girardot de Pr&eacute;fond with their cabinets of
marvels. If the crowds in the old-fashioned libraries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
are like the multitude at Babel, these tall volumes in
crushed morocco and 'triple gold bands' remind us of
what our antiquaries have said of books glimmering in
their wire cases 'like eastern beauties peering through
their jalousies.' We ought to say something of
M. de Chamillard, best known in his public capacity
as a good match for the King at billiards and as the
minister who proposed the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes. In private life Michael de Chamillard was
a virtuoso with well-filled galleries and portfolios;
and he had assembled a large company of books of
fashionable appearance. But our real interest is not
so much with the Minister of Billiards, as M. Uzanne
described him, but rather with his wife and three
daughters, who were all true female bibliophiles. The
eldest daughter, the Marquise de Dreux, was wife of
the Grand Master of the Ceremonies; but though his
collection was gay and polite the Marquise insisted
on a separate establishment for the books that she
had discovered and bought and bound. The Duchesse
de la Feuillade and the Duchesse de Lorges insisted,
like their elder sister, on having libraries for their
separate use. The minister's wife was celebrated for
the splendour of her books, and marvellous prices
have been paid for specimens of her earlier style.
But 'little Madame de Chamillard' attached herself
in all things to the Maintenon, and followed the uncrowned
queen in abandoning the paths of vanity;
she gave up the world, so far as gilt arabesques and
crushed morocco were concerned, and dressed all her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
later acquisitions <i>&agrave; la Jans&eacute;niste</i>, in plain leather with
perhaps the thinnest line of blind-tooling for an
ornament.</p>

<p>Charles du Fay was a captain in the Guards, compelled
by his misfortunes to confine himself to the
battles of the book-sale. He lost a leg at the bombardment
of Brussels in 1695; and though he was
promoted to a company in the Guards, it became at
last apparent that he could not serve on horseback.
Du Fay, we are told, was fortunately fond of literature;
and he devoted himself with eagerness to the
task of collecting a magnificent library. History and
Latin poetry had always been his favourite subjects,
and it appears that he was already collecting fine
examples in this department during his campaigns
in Germany and Flanders.</p>

<p>M. de Lincy commemorates the good taste that
impelled Du Fay to buy several of Grolier's books,
and records the industry with which he sought to
remedy his defects of education. Professor Brochard,
he says, was a learned man, with a good library of
his own, who went to inspect the books gathered
by Du Fay from all parts of Europe. The visitor
expressed surprise that out of nearly four thousand
volumes there should hardly be any in Greek.
'I have hardly retained a word of the language,'
said Du Fay. 'Cato in his old age,' replied the
Professor, 'did not hesitate for a moment to learn
it; and a person quite ignorant of Greek can never
know Latin well.' Du Fay was an easy good-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>natured
man, and at once followed his friend's
advice, beginning from that day to buy Greek books
and to work at the language so as to be able to read
them. His object, however, in forming a library was
not so much to gather useful information as to set
up a museum of literary rarities. The idea is in
accordance with our modern taste, and perhaps with
the common sense of mankind; but some of the old-fashioned
collectors were angry with the poor epicure
of learning. The Pr&eacute;sident Bouhier writes to Marais
in 1725 on seeing a catalogue of the library: 'This
savours more of bibliomania than scholarship.' Marais
at once replied: 'Your judgment on Du Fay's catalogue
is most excellent: it is not a library, but a
shop full of curious book-specimens, made to sell
and not to keep for one's self.'</p>

<p>Many of Du Fay's books were bought by Count
d'Hoym, who lived for many years at Paris as ambassador
from Augustus of Poland and Saxony.
The Count has been accused of showing bad manners
at Court, and of bad faith in giving the trade secrets
of Dresden to the factory at S&egrave;vres; in bibliography
at any rate, he was supreme among the amateurs,
and his White Eagle of Poland appears upon no
volume that is not among the best of its kind. He
sat at one time at the feet of the Abb&eacute; de Rothelin;
but he soon became his master's equal in matters of
taste, and was accepted until his exile at Nancy as
the arbiter of elegance among the Parisians. M. Guigard
quotes from the dedication of a 'treasury' of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
French poetry a passage that indicates his high
position: 'To the poets in this assemblage, whoever
they be, it is a glory, Monseigneur, to enter your
Excellency's library, so full, so magnificent, so well
chosen, that it is justly accounted the prodigy of
learning.'</p>

<p>Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans, Abb&eacute; de Rothelin, had died in
1744, when most of his books became the property
of the nation. In some respects he was the most
distinguished of the book-collectors. His learning
and wealth enabled him to make a collection of theology
that has never been surpassed; and he had the
good fortune to acquire the vast series of State Papers
and the priceless medi&aelig;val <span class="smcap">mss.</span> collected by Nicolas
Foucault. His special taste was for immaculate
editions in splendid bindings; but nothing escaped
his notice that was in any way remarkable or interesting.</p>

<p>Paul Girardot de Pr&eacute;fond was a timber-merchant
who fell into an apathetic state on retiring from
active business. His physician, Hyacinthe Baron,
was an eminent book-collector, and he advised the
patient to take up the task of forming a library. So
successful was the prescription that the merchant
became renowned during the next half century for
his superb bindings, his specimens from Grolier's
stores, and the Delphin and Variorum classics which
he procured from the library of Gascq de la Lande.
On two occasions the sale of his surplus treasures
made an excitement for the literary world. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of his rarest books were sold in 1757, and twelve
years afterwards his Delphin series and the greater
part of his general collection were purchased by
Count Macarthy.</p>

<p>M&eacute;rard de St. Just was another collector, whose
exquisite taste is still gratefully remembered, though
his small library has long been dispersed, and was indeed
almost destroyed by a series of accidents before
the outbreak of the great Revolution. 'My library,' he
said, 'is very small, but it is too large for me to fill
it with good books.' He would not have the first
editions of the classics, because they were generally
printed on bad paper which it was disagreeable to
touch, with the exception of works produced by the
Aldine Press. Nor would he buy mere curiosities,
says Guigard, but left them to persons who cared for
empty display, 'like one who proudly exhibits his
patents of nobility without being able to point to
any distinguished action of his ancestors.' He was
the owner of many choice books that had belonged
to Gaignat and Charron de M&eacute;nars, or had been
bound for Madame de Pompadour, or to the undiscriminating
Du Barry. In 1782, we are told, he despatched
the best part of his library to America, but
had the grief of learning soon afterwards that they had
been captured at sea by the English. His philosophical
temper was shown in his reply to the bad news: 'I
have but one wish upon the subject; I hope that the
person who gets this part of the booty will be able
to comprehend the value of the treasure that has
come to his hands.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The elder Mirabeau was a collector of another type.
The 'friend of mankind' intended to gather together
the best and largest library in the world. He cared
nothing for the scarcity or the external adornments
of a volume; but he had a huge appetite for knowledge,
and he longed to have the means of referring to all
that could illustrate the progress of the race. He did
not live to attain any marked success in his gigantic
design; but his library had at least the distinction of
containing all the books of the Comte de Buffon, enriched
with marginal notes in the naturalist's handwriting.</p>

<p>A modest collection was formed a few years afterwards
by Pierre-Louis Guinguen&eacute;, who wrote a valuable
work on the literary history of Italy. He is remembered
as having published amid the terrors of 1791
an amusing essay on the authority of Rabelais 'in
the matter of this present Revolution.' He led a
peaceful life through all that troubled time, and succeeded
in forming a very useful library containing
about 3000 volumes; it was purchased for the British
Museum on his death, and became the foundation of
the great series of works on the French Revolution
which has been brought together there.</p>

<p>The long life of M. Antoine Renouard bridges over
the space between the days of Mirabeau and the time
when the <i>&eacute;l&eacute;gants</i> of the Third Empire had invented
a new bibliomania. Renouard had ordered bindings
from the elder Der&ocirc;me; in 1785 he bought a book at
La Valli&egrave;re's sale. In his <i>Epictetus</i> there is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
following note: 'Bought in May 1785, the first book
printed on vellum that entered my library; rather
luxurious for a young fellow of seventeen, but then
all my little savings were devoted to acquiring books;
parties of pleasure, and elegancies of toilette, everything
was sacrificed to my beloved books; and at that
time a brisk and brilliant business permitted expenses
which were followed by hard years of privation; it
was in my first youth that I found it easiest to spend
money on my books.' Renouard began life as a
manufacturer. His father made gauze stuffs, and
kept a shop in the Rue Apolline. In 1787 the
Abb&eacute; le Blond, the librarian of the Coll&egrave;ge Mazarin,
heard that Molini had sold a fine Aldine Horace to a
shopkeeper. 'The next day,' says Renouard, 'Le
Blond came into my library. "Oh! I shall not have
the book," he exclaimed, and when I looked round,
he said, "I beg your pardon, I hoped to tempt you
with a few <i>louis</i> for your bargain, but I have given
up the idea at once, and I only ask the double favour
of seeing the book and of being allowed to make your
acquaintance."' Renouard was the historian of the
House of Aldus, and naturally became the possessor
of some of Grolier's finest books. During his career
as a bookseller he parted with most of them; and at
the sale of his library in 1854 the 'Lucretius,' the
'Virgil,' and the 'Erasmus,' were all that remained in
his collection.</p>

<h3>LATER ENGLISH COLLECTORS.</h3>


<p>In describing the English collections of the
eighteenth century we have the advantage of using
the memoranda of William Oldys for the earlier part
of the period. D'Israeli deplored the carelessness
which led the 'literary antiquary' to entrust his discoveries
and reminiscences to the fly-leaves of notebooks,
to 'parchment budgets,' and paper-bags of
extracts. He expressed especial disappointment at
the loss of the manuscript on London Libraries, with
its anecdotes of book-collectors and remarks on booksellers
and the first publishers of catalogues. The
book has come to light since his time, having been
discovered among the important collections bequeathed
by Dr. William Hunter to the University of Glasgow;
it was published by Mr. W. J. Thoms about the year
1862 in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, and was afterwards printed
by him in a volume containing a diary and other
'choice notes' by Oldys and an interesting memoir of
his life. 'In his own departments of learning,' says Mr.
Thoms, 'Oldys exhausted all the ordinary sources
of information,' and adds that 'his copious and characteristic
accounts of men and books have endeared
his memory to every lover of English literature.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Oldys had some special advantages as a collector of
old English poetry. He knew, as no one else at that
time knew, the value of the plays and pamphlets that
encumbered the stalls; he had no competitor to fear
'clad in the invulnerable mail of the purse.' Oldys
was born in 1696; he became involved, while quite a
young man, in the disaster of the South Sea Bubble;
and in 1724 he was obliged to leave London for a
residence of some years in Yorkshire. Among the
books that he abandoned was the first of his annotated
copies of <i>Langbaine</i>, which he found afterwards in
the hands of a miserly fellow, begrudging him even a
sight of the notes. 'When I returned,' he writes, 'I
understood that my books had been dispersed; and
afterwards, becoming acquainted with Mr. Thomas
Coxeter, I found that he had bought my <i>Langbaine</i>
of a bookseller who was a great collector of plays and
poetical books.' His autobiography shows that he
soon restored his literary losses. His patron, Lord
Oxford, for whom he afterwards worked as librarian,
was anxious to buy everything that was rare. 'The
Earl,' says Oldys, 'invited me to show him my collections
of manuscripts, historical and political, which
had been the Earl of Clarendon's, my collections of
Royal Letters and other papers of State, together
with a very large collection of English heads in
sculpture.' Mr. Thoms quotes a note from the
<i>Langbaine</i> to show that Oldys had bought two
hundred volumes 'at the auction of the Earl of
Stamford's library at St. Paul's Coffee-house, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
formerly most of the celebrated libraries were sold.'
It was while Oldys was living in Yorkshire, under
the patronage of Lord Malton, that he saw the end
of the library of State Papers collected by Richard
Gascoyne the antiquary. The noble owner of the
<span class="smcap">mss.</span> had been advised to destroy the papers by
a lawyer, Mr. Samuel Buck of Rotherham, 'who
could not read one of those records any more than
his lordship'; but he feared that they might contain
legal secrets or disclose flaws in a title or, as Oldys
said, 'that something or other might be found out one
time or other by somebody or other.' Richard
Gascoyne, he adds, possessed a vast and most valuable
collection of deeds, evidences, and ancient records,
which after his death, about the time of the Restoration,
came to the family of the first Earl of Strafford.
They were kept in the stone tower at Wentworth
Woodhouse until 1728, when Lord Malton 'burnt
them all wilfully in one morning.' 'I saw the lamentable
fire,' says Oldys, 'feed upon six or seven great
chests full of the said deeds, some of them as old as
the Conquest, and even the ignorant servants repining.... I
did prevail to the preservation of some few
old rolls and public grants and charters, a few extracts
of escheats, and original letters of some eminent
persons and pedigrees of others, but not the hundredth
part of much better things that were destroyed.'</p>

<p>One or two extracts from the 'diary and choice
notes' will show the minute attention given by Oldys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to everything concerned with books. Under the date
of June 29th, 1737, we read: 'Saw Mr. Ames' old
<span class="smcap">mss.</span> on vellum, entitled <i>Le Romant de la Rose</i>, which
cost forty crowns at Paris when first written, as appears
by the inscription at the end: it had been
Bishop Burnet's book, his arms being pasted in it,
and Mr. Rawlinson's, being mentioned in one of his
catalogues; in the same catalogue also is mentioned
Sir William Monson's collection, which Mr. West
bought and lent me before the fatal fire happened at
his chambers in the Temple.' Mr. Thorns adds that
Sir William Monson, an Admiral of note in the reign
of James <span class="smcap">i.</span>, formed considerable collections, principally
about naval affairs. Under the date of August
8th, we read of a visit to Strype the historian. 'Invited
by Dr. Harris to his brother's at Homerton,
where old Mr. Strype is still alive, and has the remainder
of his once rich collection of <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, tracts,
etc.' Dr. Knight's letter of a few months' earlier
date was printed by Nichols in his <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>.
'I made a visit to old Father Strype when in town
last: he is turned ninety, yet very brisk, and with
only a decay of sight and memory.... He told me
that he had great materials towards the life of the
old Lord Burleigh and Mr. Foxe the martyrologist,
which he wished he could have finished, but most of
his papers are in "characters"; his grandson is learning
to decipher them.' Under the dates of September
1st and 7th Oldys records that 'the Yelverton
library is in the possession of the Earl of Sussex,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
wherein are many volumes of Sir Francis Walsingham's
papers'; and a few days later, 'Dr. Pepusch
offered me any intelligence or assistance from his
ancient collections of music, for a history of that
art and its professors in England; and as to
dramatic affairs, he notes that the Queen's set of
Plays had at first been thought too dear; but after
Mrs. Oldfield the actress died, and they were reported
to be his collection, then the Queen would have them
at any rate.' When Oldys died his curious library
was purchased by Thomas Davies, and was put up
to auction in 1762. The list of printed books comprises
many literary treasures which in our days can
hardly be procured, but at that time went for a song.
'The manuscripts were not so many as might be expected
from so indefatigable a writer'; it seems that
Oldys had always been too generous with his gifts
and loans.</p>

<p>Among his notices of the London libraries we
find an interesting account of the collection at Lambeth,
then housed in the galleries above the cloisters.
'The oldest of the books were Dudley's, the Earl of
Leicester, which from time to time have been augmented
by several Archbishops of that See. It had
a great loss in being deprived of Archbishop
Sheldon's admirable collection of missals, breviaries,
primers, etc., relating to the service of the Church, as
also Archbishop Sancroft's.' The books and <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
belonging to Sancroft had in part been deposited at
Lambeth; but on his deprivation they were removed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to Emmanuel College at Cambridge. Oldys added
that there was another apartment for <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, 'not only
those belonging to the See, but those of the Lord
Carew, who had been Deputy of Ireland, many of
them relating to the state and history of that kingdom.'</p>

<p>Archbishop Tenison had furnished another noble
library near St. Martin's Lane 'with the best modern
books in most faculties'; 'there any student might
repair and make what researches he pleased'; and
there too were deposited Sir James Ware's important
Irish <span class="smcap">mss.</span> and many other portions of the Clarendon
Collection, until offence was taken at their having
been catalogued among the papers of the Archbishop.</p>

<p>In Dulwich College there was another library to
which Mr. Cartwright the actor gave a collection of
plays and many excellent pictures; and 'here comes
in,' says Oldys, 'the Queen's purchase of plays, and
those by Mr. Weever the dancing-master, Sir Charles
Cotterell, Mr. Coxeter, Lady Pomfret, and Lady
Mary Wortley Montague'; and here we might mention
the sad case of Mr. Warburton the herald, whose
forte was to find out valuable English plays. Shortly
before his death in 1759 he discovered that the cook
had used up about fifty of the <span class="smcap">mss.</span> for covering pies,
and that among them were 'twelve unpublished
pieces by Massinger.' Something may be said too as
to the older collections formed in London for the use
of schools. At Westminster, it has been well said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Dean Williams 'enlarged the boundaries of learning.'
According to Hackett, he converted a waste room
into a noble library, modelling it 'into a decent
shape,' and furnishing it with a vast number of
learned volumes. The best of them came from the
library of Mr. Baker of Highgate, who throughout
a very long life had been gathering 'the best authors
of all sciences in their best editions.' Dean Colet
had endowed St. Paul's School with philological
works in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin; but these were
destroyed in the great fire, together with the whole
library of the High Master. This was Mr. Samuel
Cromleholme, who had the best set of neatly-bound
classics in London; 'he was a great lover of his
books, and their loss hastened the end of his life.'
The shelves at Merchant Taylors and in the Mercers'
Chapel were almost as well filled as those at St.
Paul's; and Christ's Hospital at that time had a
good plain library in the mathematical school, with
globes and instruments, 'and ships with all their
rigging for the instruction of lads designed for the
sea.'</p>

<p>In the College of Physicians was a fine collection
'in their own and the other faculties.' Selden
bequeathed to it his 'physical books,' and it was enriched
by a gift of the whole library of Lord
Dorchester, 'the pride and glory of the College.'
We can only mention a few of the libraries described
by Oldys. The Jews, he says, had a collection at
Bevis Marks relating to the Talmud and Mischna and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
their ceremonial worship: the French Protestants
had another at the Savoy, and the Swedes another
at their Church in Trinity Lane. The Baptists
owned a great library in the Barbican. The Quakers
had been for some years furnishing a library with
all the works written by the Friends. John Whiting
published the catalogue in 1708; 'and in my opinion,'
says our critic, ''tis more accurately and perfectly
drawn up than the Bodleian Library at Oxford is by
Dr. Hyde, for the Quaker does not confound one
man with another as the scholar does.' Francis Bugg,
he adds, 'the scribbler against them,' had a better
collection of their writings than any of the brethren;
'but I think I have read in some of his rhapsodies
that he either gave or sold it to the library at
Oxford.'</p>

<p>Charles Earl of Sunderland was the greatest collector
of his time. He bought the whole library of
Hadrian Beverland, 'which was very choice of its
kind,' and a great number of P&eacute;tau's books as mentioned
before; 'no bookseller,' it was said, 'hath so
many editions of the same book as he, for he hath all,
especially of the classics.' Shortly before his death in
1772 he commissioned Mr. Vaillant to buy largely at
the sale of Mr. Freebairn's library. In Clarke's
<i>Repertorium</i> we are told how a fine Virgil was
secured: 'and it was noted that when Mr. Vaillant
had bought the printed Virgil at &pound;46 he huzza'd out
aloud, and threw up his hat for joy that he had
bought it so cheap.' The great collection was after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>wards
taken to Blenheim, and has been dispersed in
our time; 'the King of Denmark proffered the heirs
&pound;30,000 for it, and "Queen Zara" would have inclined
them to part with it.' When the Earl of
Sunderland died, Humphrey Wanley saw a good
chance for the Harleian. 'I believe some benefit
may accrue to this library, even if his relations
will part with none of the works; I mean by his
raising the price of books no higher now; so that in
probability this commodity may fall in the market,
and any gentleman be permitted to buy an uncommon
old book for less than forty or fifty pounds.'
If we listen to the Rev. Thomas Baker, the ejected
Fellow who gave 4000 books to St. John's at Cambridge,
we shall hear a complaint against Wanley.
Lord Oxford's librarian when he saw a fine book, even
in a public institution, used to say, 'It will be better in
my lord's library.' Baker might have said, 'a plague
on both your houses!' What he wrote was as
follows:&mdash;'I begin to complain of the men of quality
who lay out so much for books, and give such prices
that there is nothing to be had for poor scholars,
whereof I have felt the effects; when I bid a fair
price for an old book, I am answered, "The quality
will give twice as much," and so I have done.'</p>

<p>The Earls of Pembroke were for several generations
the patrons of learning. 'Thomas, the eighth Earl,
was contemporary with those illustrious characters,
Sunderland, Harley, and Mead, during the Augustan
age of Britain'; he added a large number of classics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and early printed books to the library at Wilton, and
his successor Earl Henry still further improved it by
adding the best works on architecture, on biographies,
and books of numismatics; 'the Earl of Pembroke is
stored with antiquities relating to medals and lives.'</p>

<p>Lord Somers had the rare pieces in law and English
history which have been published in a well-known
series of tracts. Lord Carbury loved mystical
divinity; the Earl of Kent was all for pedigrees and
visitations; the Earl of Kinnoul made large collections
in mathematics and civil law; and Lord
Coleraine followed Bishop Kennett in forming 'a
library of lives.'</p>

<p>Richard Smith was remembered as having started
in the pursuit of Caxtons in the days of Charles <span class="smcap">ii.</span>;
the taste was despised when Oldys wrote, but
it eventually grew into a mania. 'For a person
of an inferior rank we never had a collector more
successful. No day passed over his head in which he
did not visit Moorfields and Little Britain or St. Paul's
Churchyard, and for many years together he suffered
nothing to escape him that was rare and remarkable.'</p>

<p>Mr. John Bridges of Lincoln's Inn was another
'notorious book-collector.' When his books were
sold in 1726 the prices ran so high that the world
suspected a conspiracy on the part of the executors.
Humphrey Wanley was disappointed in his commissions,
and called it a roguish sale; of the vendors
he remarked 'their very looks, according to what I
am told, dart out harping-irons.' Tom Hearne went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Mr. Bridges' chambers to see the sale, and descanted
upon the fine condition of the lots: 'I was told of a
gentleman of All Souls that gave a commission of
eight shillings for an Homer, but it went for six
guineas; people are in love with good binding rather
than good reading.' Some of the entries in the
catalogue are of great interest. The first edition of
Homer, printed at Florence in 1488 on large paper,
went for about a quarter of the price of an Aldine
Livy. Lord Oxford secured a 'Lucian' in uncial
characters, and a splendid Missal illuminated for
Henry <span class="smcap">vii.</span> There was a large-paper 'Politian' in
two volumes, very carelessly described as 'finely
bound by Grolier and his friends'; but the best of
all was the <span class="smcap">ms.</span> Horace, with an exquisite portrait of
the poet, 'from the library of Matthias Corvinus,
King of Hungary.'</p>

<p>Dr. Mead was a collector of the same kind. All
that was beautiful came naturally to this great man, of
whom it was said that he lived 'in the full sunshine
of human existence.' He was the owner of a very
fine library, which he had 'picked up at Rome.' He
had a great number of early-printed classics, which
fetched high prices at his sale in 1754; his French
books, according to Dibdin, and all his works upon
the fine arts 'were of the first rarity and value,' and
were sumptuously bound. His chief literary distinction
rests on his edition of De Thou's 'History' in
seven folio volumes. He had received a large legacy
from a brother, and spent it in the publication of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
work 'from which nothing of exterior pomp and
beauty should be wanting'; the ink and paper were
procured from Holland; and Carte the historian was
sent to France 'to rummage for <span class="smcap">mss.</span> of Thuanus.'</p>

<p>Oldys has a few notes upon curious collections
which he thought might be diverting to a 'satirical
genius.' A certain Templar, he says, had a good
library of astrology, witchcraft, and magic. Mr
Britton, the small-coal man, had an excellent set of
chemical books,'and a great parcel of music books,
many of them pricked with his own hand.' The
famous Dryden, and Mr. Congreve after him, had collected
old ballads and penny story-books. The melancholy
Burton, and Dr. Richard Rawlinson, and the
learned Thomas Hearne, had all been as bad in their
way. Mr. Secretary Pepys gave a great library to
Magdalen College at Cambridge: but among the folios
peeped out little black-letter ballads and 'penny
merriments, penny witticisms, penny compliments,
and penny godlinesses.' 'Mr. Robert Samber,' says
Oldys, 'must need turn virtuoso too, and have his
collection: which was of all the printed tobacco-papers
he could anywhere light on.'</p>

<p>For 'curiosity or dotage' none could beat Mr.
Thomas Rawlinson, whose vast collections were dispersed
in seventeen or eighteen auctions before the
final sale in 1733. Mr. Heber in the present century
is a modern example of the same kind. 'A book is a
book,' he said: and he bought all that came in his way,
by cart-loads and ship-loads, and in whole libraries, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
which in some cases he never cast his eyes. The
most zealous lovers of books have smiled at his
duplicates, quadruplicates, and multiplied specimens
of a single edition.</p>

<p>Thomas Rawlinson, for all his continual sales,
blocked himself out of house and home by his purchases:
his set of chambers at Gray's Inn was so
completely filled with books that his bed had to be
moved into the passage. Some thought that he was
the 'Tom Folio' of Addison's caricature, in which it
was assumed that the study of bibliography was only
fit for a 'learned idiot.' Hearne defended his friend
from the charge of pedantry, and declared that the
mistake could only be made by a 'shallow buffoon.'</p>

<p>Rawlinson had a miserly craving after good books.
If he had twenty copies of a work he would always
open his purse for 'a different edition, a fairer copy, a
larger paper.' His covetousness increased as the
mass of his library was multiplied: and as he lived,
said Oldys, so he died, among dust and cobwebs, 'in
his bundles, piles, and bulwarks of paper.'</p>

<p>Upon Dr. Mead's death his place in the book-world
was taken by Dr. Anthony Askew, who travelled far
and wide in search of rare editions and large-paper
copies. In describing the sale of his books in 1775
Dibdin almost lost himself in ecstasies over the magnificent
folios, and the shining duodecimos 'printed
on vellum and embossed with knobs of gold.' It has
been said that with this sale commenced the new
era in bibliography, during which such fabulous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
prices were given for fine editions of the classics; but
the date should perhaps be carried back to Dr. Mead's
time. Some credit for the new development should
also be ascribed to Joseph Smith, who collected early-printed
books and classics at Venice, while acting as
English consul. His first library was purchased by
George <span class="smcap">iii.</span> in 1762, and now forms the best part of
the 'King's Library' at the British Museum. His
later acquisitions were sold in 1773 by public auction
in London. Among other classical libraries of an
old-fashioned kind we should notice the Osterley Park
collection, only recently dispersed, which was formed
by Bryan Fairfax; it was purchased <i>en bloc</i> in 1756
by Mr. Francis Child, and passed from him to the
family of the Earl of Jersey.</p>

<p>Topham Beauclerc housed his thirty thousand
volumes, as Walpole declared, in a building that
reached halfway from London to Highgate; his collection
was in two parts, of which the first was mainly
classical, and the other was very rich in English
antiquities and history. In 1783 was sold almost the
last of the encyclop&aelig;dic collections which used to
fill the position now occupied by great public libraries.
Mr. Crofts possessed a treasury of Greek and Roman
learning; he was especially rich in philology, in
Italian literature, in travels, in Scandinavian affairs;
'under the shortest heads, some one or more rare
articles occur, but in the copious classes literary
curiosity is gratified, is highly feasted.'</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson's books were dispersed in a four-days'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sale in 1785. A copy of the interesting catalogue
has lately been reprinted by The Club. The most
valuable specimen, as a mere curiosity, would be the
folio with which he beat the bookseller, but we suppose
that very little on the whole was obtained for
the 662 lots of learned volumes that had sprawled
over his dusty floor. The Doctor had but little
sympathy with the fashions that were beginning to
prevail. He laughs in the <i>Rambler</i> at 'Cantilenus'
with his first edition of <i>The Children in the Wood</i>,
and the antiquary who despaired of obtaining one
missing Gazette till it was sent to him 'wrapped round
a parcel of tobacco.' 'Hirsutus,' we are told,'very
carefully amassed all the English books that were
printed in the black character'; the fortunate virtuoso
had 'long since completed his Caxton, and wanted
but two volumes of a perfect Pynson.' In our own
day we can hardly realise the idea of such riches;
but the 'Rambler' scouted the notion of slighting or
valuing a book because it was printed in the Roman
or Gothic type. John Ratcliffe of Bermondsey was
one of these 'black-letter dogs.' He had some advantages
of birth and position; for, being a chandler
and grocer, he could buy these old volumes by weight
in the course of his trade. He died in 1776, the
master of a whole 'galaxy of Caxtons'; his library
is said to have held the essence of poetry, romance
and history; it was more precious in flavour to the
new <i>dilettanti</i> than the copious English stores of
James West, the judicious President of the Royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Society; it was far more refined than the 'omnium
gatherum' scattered in 1788 on Major Pearson's
death, or Dr. Farmer's ragged regiments of old plays
and frowsy ballads, and square-faced broadsides
'bought for thrice their weight in gold.'</p>

<p>M. Paris de Meyzieux was the owner of a splendid
library. Dibdin has described his third sale, held in
London during 1791, when the bibliomaniacs, it was
said, used to cool themselves down with ice before
they could face such excitement. Of himself he
confessed that when he had seen the illuminations
of Nicolas Jany, the snow-white 'Petrarch,' the 'Virgil'
on vellum, life had no more to offer: 'after having
seen only these three books I hope to descend to my
obscure grave in perfect peace and happiness.' The
<i>Livre d'Heures</i> printed for Francis <span class="smcap">i.</span>, which had
belonged to the Duc de la Valli&egrave;re, was bought by
Sir Mark Sykes, and became one of his principal
treasures at Sledmere.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Heathcote had a most elegant library,
in which might be seen the tallest Elzevirs and
several Aldine classics 'in the chaste costume of
Grolier.' It is said that the books passed lightly into
his hands 'in a convivial moment,' much to their former
owner's regret. About the year 1807 they passed
into the miscellaneous crowd of Mr. Dent's books;
and twenty years afterwards the whole collection
was dispersed at a low price, when the book-mania
was giving way for a time to an affection for cheap
and useful literature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The fever was still high in 1810 when Mr. Heath's
plain classics were snatched up at very extravagant
terms. Colonel Stanley's library was typical of the
taste of the day. His selection comprised rare
Spanish and Italian poetry, novels and romances,
'De Bry's voyages complete, fine classics, and a
singular set of <i>faceti&aelig;</i>.' It was sold in 1813, a few
weeks after the dispersal of Mr. John Hunter's very
similar collection. This was immediately followed
by an auction of Mr. Gosset's books, which lasted for
twenty-three days: they seem to have chiefly consisted
of divinity and curious works on philology.
Mr. John Towneley's library was sold a few months
afterwards. Mr. Towneley was the owner of a fine
'Pontifical' of Innocent <span class="smcap">iv.</span>, and a missal by Giulio
Clovio from the Farnese palace; his celebrated <span class="smcap">ms.</span>,
known as the 'Towneley Iliad,' was bought by Dr.
Charles Burney, and passed with the rest of his
books to the British Museum. In 1816 Mr. Michael
Wodhull died, after half-a-century spent in the steady
collection of good books in the auctions of London
and Paris: the recent sale of his library has made
all the world familiar with his well-selected volumes,
bound in russia by his faithful Roger Payne, and
annotated on their fly-leaves with valuable memoranda
of book-lore. We shall not repeat the story of
Mr. Beckford's triumphant career, of the glories of
Fonthill or the later splendours of the Hamilton
Palace collection. We should note his purchase of
Gibbon's books 'in order to have something to read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
on passing through Lausanne.' 'I shut myself up,'
said Mr. Beckford, 'for six weeks from early in the
morning till night, only now and then taking a ride;
the people thought me mad; I read myself nearly
blind.' Beckford never saw the books again 'after
once turning hermit there.' He gave them to his
physician, Dr. Scholl, and they were sold by auction
in 1833; most of them were scattered about the
world, but some are said to be still preserved at
Lausanne in the public library.</p>

<p>This period was marked by the rivalry between
bibliophiles of high rank and great wealth, whose
Homeric contests have been worthily described by
Dibdin in his history of the Bibliomania. A note
in one of the Althorp Caxtons records a more
amicable arrangement. The book belonged to Mr.
George Mason, at whose sale it was bought by the
Duke of Roxburghe: 'The Duke and I had agreed
not to oppose one another at the sale, but after the
book was bought, to toss up who should win it, when
I lost it; I bought it at the Roxburghe sale on the
17th of June, 1812, for &pound;215 5s.' The Duke was
chiefly interested in old English literature, Italian
poetry, and romances of the Round Table; but we
are told that shortly before his death he was 'in full
pursuit of a collection of our dramatic authors.' It
was at his sale that the Valdarfer Boccaccio was
purchased by Lord Blandford, afterwards Duke of
Marlborough, for &pound;2260, a sum which at that time
had never been reached as the price of a single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
volume. It passed into the great collection at White
Knights, which then contained, in addition to some of
the rarest English books, the 'Bedford Missal,' another
missal given by Queen Louise to Marguerite d'Angoul&ecirc;me,
and a volume of prayers from the hand of the
caligrapher Nicolas Jany. On the 17th of June,
1819, the White Knights library was sold on behalf
of the owner's creditors; and the 'Boccaccio' found a
safe home at Althorp, where George, Earl Spencer,
had by fortunate purchases, by zeal in the pursuit of
books, and by the aid of an accomplished librarian,
formed that matchless collection which Renouard
justly described as 'the finest private library in
Europe.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
